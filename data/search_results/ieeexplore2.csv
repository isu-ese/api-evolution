An Experience Report of the API Evolution and Maintenance for Software Platforms,H. Kwon; J. Ahn; S. Choi; J. Siewierski; P. Kosko; P. Szydelko,NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,2018 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME),,2018,,,587,590,"Development and maintenance of software plat-form APIs are challenging because new APIs are constantly added in new software platforms. Furthermore, software plat-form API development requires a lot of stakeholders to work together on tight release schedules. Application developers use platform's APIs to create their applications and therefore providing a well-defined and comprehensive set of platform APIs may be the most basic requirement for software platforms. To provide such APIs, API usability should be secured and API backward compatibility should be guaranteed in subsequent platform re-leases. In these circumstances, sharing lessons learned from multiple years of experience of platform API development, mainte-nance, and releases using an integrated API development process can benefit API researchers and practitioners who have similar needs to create or adopt API development process for their projects. In this paper we share an API development and mainte-nance process for multi-device Tizen software platform, which we call the Tizen API Change Request (ACR) process. The process has been used among various Tizen API stakeholders for several years of Tizen platform and SDK releases to keep API usability and compatibility high. We believe the process can be further applied to various software platforms and projects to systematically develop and maintain their APIs.",2576-3148;1063-6773,978-1-5386-7870-1978-1-5386-7871,10.1109/ICSME.2018.00034,,https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxybz.lib.montana.edu:3443/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8530070,API development;API maintenance;software platform APIs;API review;multi-device APIs,Stakeholders;Tools;Usability;Security;Maintenance engineering;Electronic mail,application program interfaces;software maintenance,API evolution;application developers;platform APIs;API usability;API backward compatibility;platform API development;integrated API development process;API researchers;multidevice Tizen software platform;Tizen API stakeholders;Tizen API change request process;subsequent platform releases;software platform API development,,,,22,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
API Evolution with RefactoringNG,Z. Tronicek,NA,2010 Second World Congress on Software Engineering,,2010,2,,293,297,"When frameworks and libraries evolve, they often change interfaces. Upgrade to a new version of framework or library leads to changing code manually. We describe a new refactoring tool for the Java programming language that enables automatic migration to a new framework or library, provided that library authors delivered the refactoring rules.",,978-1-4244-9287,10.1109/WCSE.2010.107,,https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxybz.lib.montana.edu:3443/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718396,Java;refactoring;API evolution;NetBeans,Java;Libraries;Syntactics;Boats;Sun;Software engineering,application program interfaces;Java;software libraries;software maintenance,API evolution;RefactoringNG;Java programming language;library;Java refactoring tool,,,,9,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

It provides an API to extend the platform with plug-ins to upload additional data or to enrich its functionalities. The SourceMeter plug-in for SONARQUBETM platform integrates the SourceMeter static source code analyzer tool into the SONARQUBETM platform, i.e., uploads the analysis results and extends the GUI to be able to present the new results. The first version of the plug-in was released in 2015 and was compatible with the corresponding SONARQUBETM version. However, the platform - and what is more important, its API - have evolved a lot since then, therefore the plug-in had to be adapted to the new API. It was not just a slight adjustment, though, because we had to redesign and reimplement the whole UI and, at the same time, perform significant alterations in other parts of the plug-in as well. Besides, we examined the effect of the API evolution on other open-source plug-ins and found that most of them still remain compatible with the latest version, even if they have not been updated alongside the underlying API modifications. The reason for this is that these plug-ins use only a small part of the API that have not changed over time.",1534-5351,978-1-7281-0591-8978-1-7281-0592,10.1109/SANER.2019.8667988,,https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxybz.lib.montana.edu:3443/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8667988,SourceMeter;SonarQube;plug-in;API;evolution;software quality;metrics;clone detection;coding issues,Graphical user interfaces;Measurement;Tools;Open source software;Encoding;Java,application program interfaces;graphical user interfaces;program diagnostics;public domain software;software maintenance;software management;software quality;software tools;source code (software),open-source plug-ins;open-source tool;continuous code quality management;SourceMeter plug-in;SourceMeter static source code analyzer tool;API evolution;SONARQUBE plug-in maintenance;SONARQUBE platform;GUI;API modifications,,,,10,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences
