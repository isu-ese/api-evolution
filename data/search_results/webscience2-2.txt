AB The process of migrating software between languages is called language migration or code migration. To reduce manual effort in defining the rules of API mappings for code migration, in this work, we investigate a data-driven model that statistically learns the mappings between API usages from the corpus of the corresponding methods in the client code of the APIs in two languages.

AB Software maintenance is a relevant and expensive phase of the software development process. Developers have to deal with legacy and undocumented code that hinders the comprehension of the software system at hand. Enhancing program comprehension by means of recommender systems in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a solution to assist developers in these tasks. The recommender systems proposed so far generally share common weaknesses: they are not proactive, they consider a single type of data-source, and in case of multiple data-source, relevant items are suggested together without considering interactions among them.
   We envision a future where recommender systems follow a holistic approach: They provide knowledge regarding a programming context by considering information beyond the one provided by single elements in the context of the software development. The recommender system should consider different elements such as development artifact (e.g., bug reports, mailing lists), and online resources (e.g., blogs, Q&A web sites, API documentation), developers activities, repository history etc. The provided information should be novel and emerge from the semantic links created by the analysis of the interactions among these elements.

AB In recent years, the market of mobile software applications (apps) has maintained an impressive upward trajectory. As of today, the market for such devices features over 850K+ apps for Android, and 19 versions of the Android API have been released in 4 years. There is evidence that Android apps are highly dependent on the underlying APIs, and APIs instability (change proneness) and fault-proneness are a threat to the success of those apps. Therefore, the goal of this research is to create an approach that helps developers of Android apps to be better prepared for Android platform updates as well as the updates from third-party libraries that can potentially (and inadvertently) impact their apps with breaking changes and bugs. Thus, we hypothesize that the proposed approach will help developers not only deal with platform and library updates opportunely, but also keep (and increase) the user base by avoiding many of these potential API "update" bugs.

AB In this paper we have used sentiment analysis on news articles to see its effect on stock prices. We collected our dataset using Bing API which gave us links to news articles about a specific company. As no pre-existing sentiment dictionary specifically for stock articles exited, we created a specialized sentiment dictionary only meant to analyze stock articles. Two different machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset and the accuracy of the two was compared. In order to test our results we attached an overall sentiment to each article in our data set which was compared to the predicted sentiment by the algorithm. We also compared the predicted results with the actual change in the stock prices on the market.

TI Guiding a general-purpose C verifier to prove cryptographic protocols
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SECURITY
AB We describe how to verify security properties of C code for cryptographic protocols by using a general-purpose verifier. We prove security theorems in the symbolic model of cryptography. Our techniques include: use of ghost state to attach formal algebraic terms to concrete byte arrays and to detect collisions when two distinct terms map to the same byte array; decoration of a crypto API with contracts based on symbolic terms; and expression of the attacker model in terms of C programs. We rely on the general-purpose verifier VCC; we guide VCC to prove security simply by writing suitable header files and annotations in implementation files, rather than by changing VCC itself. We formalize the symbolic model in Coq in order to justify the addition of axioms to VCC.

TI Demo: Zero Interaction Private Messaging with ZIPR

AB Messaging app developers are beginning to take the security and privacy of their users' communication more seriously. Unfortunately, a recent study has shown that the developers of many popular apps incorrectly use cryptography. As a result, they make mistakes that may result in trivially broken encryption schemes. For example, the developers of Snapchat use a constant symmetric encryption key hardcoded into the app and it only takes 12 lines of Ruby to crack the encryption.
   In this work, we propose ZIPR (Zero-Interaction PRivacy), a system that relieves developers from the task of using cryptography correctly. Designed for text-messaging apps, ZIPR automatically negotiates shared secret keys, and encrypts and decrypts messages as users of these apps chat with each other. No manual intervention is required by users for them to enjoy secure messaging.
   There are two key ideas behind ZIPR. First, most text-messaging apps follow a basic UI scheme that contains (i) a text box for users to compose their message, (ii) a "send" button which they click on to send the message, and (iii) a list view to display sent and received messages. By intercepting events on these UI elements, ZIPR can manipulate the composed message before it is sent and before it is displayed. This allows the system to transparently encrypt and decrypt message data.
   The second key idea is that ZIPR can reuse the communication channel defined by an app to negotiate a shared secret key between two users. This is done by piggy-backing negotiation data on the messages users send to each other. A major advantage of this approach is that ZIPR can avoid the difficult task of establishing user identities. After all, a user of a text-messaging app is likely to carry out a conversation only with someone she knows, and both of them would have signed up for the chat service using some personal data such as their email addresses or phone numbers.
   Developers use ZIPR by tagging UI elements; no changes to their source code are required. This is similar to HTTPS where web developers only need to configure their servers with SSL certificates to encrypt data transmission with their users. However, unlike HTTPS, the end-to-end encryption in ZIPR takes place between the two users carrying out a conversation and not between a server and a user. This ensures that even if the app servers are compromised, users' messages would remain secure.
   ZIPR is implemented in Android 4.3 and works with existing apps with very few modifications. In this demo, we show that our current prototype works with several apps including Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, and Skype. These apps required only four, five, and three lines of modification to their UI XML definition files, respectively.
   In Figure 1, we show a screenshot of Whatsapp running under ZIPR. In the first two messages exchanged between the users, a new shared secret key is negotiated. Subsequently, all following messages are securely transmitted, and these encrypted messages are prefixed with a ``*'' by ZIPR.
   We are currently extending our prototype to use the Android Keystore API and the TrustZone hardware to allow users to identify MitM attacks, and to store the secret keys securely. We are also porting other messaging apps, such as Viber, to ZIPR.

AB Web services are the most widely used service technology that drives the Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigm. As a result, effective testing of web services is getting increasingly important. In this paper, we present a framework and toolset for testing web services and for evolving test code in sync with the evolution of web services. Our approach to testing web services is based on the Erlang [5, 9] programming language and QuviQ QuickCheck, a property-based testing tool written in Erlang, and our support for test code evolution is added to Wrangler, the Erlang refactoring tool.
   The key components of our system include the automatic generation of initial test code, the inference of web service interface changes between versions, the provision of a number of domain specific refactorings and the automatic generation of refactoring scripts for evolving the test code. Our framework provides users with a powerful and expressive web service testing framework, while minimising users' effort in creating, maintaining and evolving the test model. The framework presented in this paper can be used by both web service providers and consumers, and can be used to test web services written in whatever language; the approach advocated here could also be adopted in other property-based testing frameworks and refactoring tools.

AB Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) have become powerful and cost-effective computing platforms. Parallel programming standards (e.g. CUDA) and directive-based programming standards (like OpenHMPP and OpenACC) are available to harness this tremendous computing power to tackle large-scale modelling and simulation in scientific areas. ANUGA is a tsunami modelling application which is based on unstructured triangular meshes and implemented in Python/C.
   This paper explores issues in porting and optimizing a Python/C-based unstructured mesh application to GPUs. Two paradigms are compared: CUDA via the PyCUDA API, involving writing GPU kernels, and OpenHMPP, involving adding directives to C code. In either case, the 'naive' approach of transferring unstructured mesh data to the GPU for each kernel resulted in an actual slowdown over single core performance on a CPU. Profiling results confirmed that this is due to data transfer times of the device to/from the host, even though all individual kernels achieved a good speedup. This necessitated an advanced approach, where all key data structures are mirrored on the host and the device.
   For both paradigms, this in turn involved converting all code updating these data structures to CUDA (or directive-augmented C, in the case of OpenHMPP). Furthermore, in the case of CUDA, the porting can no longer be done incrementally: all changes must be made in a single step. For debugging, this makes identifying which kernel(s) that have introduced bugs very difficult. To alleviate this, we adopted the relative debugging technique to the host-device context. Here, when in debugging mode, the mirrored data structures are updated upon each step on both the host (using the original serial code) and the device, with any discrepancy being immediately detected. We present a generic Python-based implementation of this technique.
   With this approach, the CUDA version achieved 28x speedup, and the OpenHMPP achieved 16x. The main optimization of unstructured mesh rearrangement to achieve coalesced memory access patterns contributed to 10% of the former. In terms of productivity, however, OpenHMPP achieved significantly better speedup per hour of programming effort.

AB Over the past decade, white space networking has garnered significant effort and attention from media, industry, regulators, and academics world-wide. Together, these entities have helped push white space in to a unique position of potentially changing how we access the spectrum forever. Now, building white space networks with full-featured and fully certified equipment is critical in moving forward and retaining the spectrum and position that we have put ourselves in.
   In our demonstration, we will exhibit a fully embedded and FCC-certified white space networking platform that is available and capable of building out TV white space networks. Additionally, we provide an interactive display with data taken from our commercial deployments that further show its capabilities of supporting various applications. Using the many available channels at the conference location, we will demonstrate some of these capabilities (e.g., ability to penetrate in-door environments), as well as future capabilities (e.g., novel functionality built on the platform). With an open-API (across all layers), the platform is conducive to studying current capabilities and novel research.

AB Security and usability issues with pass-locks on mobile devices have prompted researchers to develop implicit authentication (IA) schemes, which continuously and transparently authenticate users using behavioural biometrics. Contemporary IA schemes proposed by the research community are challenging to deploy, and there is a need for a framework that supports: different behavioural classifiers, given that different apps have different requirements; app developers using IA without becoming domain experts; and real-time classification on resource-constrained mobile devices. We present Itus, an IA framework for Android that allows the research community to improve IA schemes incrementally, while allowing app developers to adopt these improvements at their own pace.
   We describe the Itus framework and how it provides: ease of use : Itus allows app developers to use IA by changing as few as two lines of their existing code-on the other hand, Itus provides an oracle capable of making advanced recommendations should developers wish to fine-tune the classifiers; flexibility : developers can deploy Itus in an application-specific manner, adapting to their unique needs; extensibility : researchers can contribute new behavioural features and classifiers without worrying about deployment particulars; low performance overhead : Itus operates with minimal performance overhead, allowing app developers to deploy it without compromising end-user experience. These goals are accomplished with an API allowing individual stakeholders to incrementally improve Itus without re-engineering new systems. We implement Itus in two demo apps and measure its performance impact. To our knowledge, Itus is the first open-source extensible IA framework for Android that can be deployed off-the-shelf.

AB The use of powerful mobile devices, like smartphones, tablets and laptops, is changing the way programmers develop software. While in the past the primary goal to optimize software was the run time optimization, nowadays there is a growing awareness of the need to reduce energy consumption.
   This paper presents a technique and a tool to detect anomalous energy consumption in Android applications, and to relate it directly with the source code of the application.
   We propose a dynamically calibrated model for energy consumption for the Android ecosystem that supports different devices. The model is used as an API to monitor the application execution: first, we instrument the application source code so that we can relate energy consumption to the application source code; second, we use a statistical approach, based on fault-localization techniques, to localize abnormal energy consumption in the source code.

AB In today's Web-centric era, embedded systems become mashup various web services via RESTful web services. RESTful web services use REST APIs that describe actions as resource state transfers via standard HTTP methods such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. While RESTful web services are lightweight and executable on any platforms that support HTTP methods, writing programs composed of only such primitive methods is not a familiar concept to developers. Therefore, no single design strategy for (fully) RESTful APIs works for arbitrary domains, and current REST APIs are system dependent, incomplete, and likely to change. To help sever-side development of REST APIs, several domain-specific languages such as WADL, WSDL 2.0, and RDF provide automatic tools to generate REST APIs. However, client-side developers who often do not know the web services domain and do not understand RESTful web services suffer from the lack of any development help.
   In this paper, we present a new approach to build JavaScript APIs that are more accessible to client-side developers than REST APIs. We show a case study of our approach that uses JavaScript APIs and their wrapper implementation instead of REST APIs, and we describe the efficiency in the client-side development.

A dynamic heterogeneous streaming application should support load balancing and fault tolerance while being capable of adapting and rearranging topologies to user needs at runtime. In this paper we present a REST API to control dynamic heterogeneous streaming applications. By means of resources, their uniform interface and hypermedia we show how it is possible to monitor, change and adapt the deployment configuration of a streaming topology at runtime.

TI Compiler-Assisted Checkpointing of Parallel Codes: The Cetus and LLVM
   Experience
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL PROGRAMMING
AB With the evolution of high-performance computing, parallel applications have developed an increasing necessity for fault tolerance, most commonly provided by checkpoint and restart techniques. Checkpointing tools are typically implemented at one of two different abstraction levels: at the system level or at the application level. The latter has become an interesting alternative due to its flexibility and the possibility of operating in different environments. However, application-level checkpointing tools often require the user to manually insert checkpoints in order to ensure that certain requirements are met (e.g. forcing checkpoints to be taken at the user code and not inside kernel routines). This paper examines the transformations required to enable automatic checkpointing of parallel applications in the CPPC application-level checkpointing framework. These transformations have been implemented on two very different compiler infrastructures: Cetus and LLVM. Cetus is a Java-based compiler infrastructure aiming to provide an easy to use and clean IR and API for program transformation. LLVM is a low-level, SSA-based toolchain. The fundamental differences of both approaches are analyzed from the structural, behavioral and performance perspectives.

TI Towards accelerating smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations for
   free-surface flows on multi-GPU clusters
SO JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB Starting from the single graphics processing unit (GPU) version of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code DualSPHysics, a multi-GPU SPH program is developed for free-surface flows. The approach is based on a spatial decomposition technique, whereby different portions (sub-domains) of the physical system under study are assigned to different GPUs. Communication between devices is achieved with the use of Message Passing Interface (MPI) application programming interface (API) routines. The use of the sorting algorithm radix sort for inter-GPU particle migration and sub-domain "halo" building (which enables interaction between SPH particles of different sub-domains) is described in detail. With the resulting scheme it is possible, on the one hand, to carry out simulations that could also be performed on a single GPU, but they can now be performed even faster than on one of these devices alone. On the other hand, accelerated simulations can be performed with up to 32 million particles on the current architecture, which is beyond the limitations of a single GPU due to memory constraints. A study of weak and strong scaling behaviour, speedups and efficiency of the resulting program is presented including an investigation to elucidate the computational bottlenecks. Last, possibilities for reduction of the effects of overhead on computational efficiency in future versions of our scheme are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

CL Indianapolis, IN
AB Emerging mobile applications that sense context are poised to delight and entertain us with timely news and events, health tracking, and social connections. Unfortunately, sensing algorithms quickly drain the phone's battery. Developers can overcome battery drain by carefully optimizing context sensing but that makes programming with context arduous and ties applications to current sensing hardware. These types of applications embody a twist on the classic tension between programmer productivity and performance due to their combination of requirements.
   This paper identifies the latency, accuracy, battery (LAB) abstraction to resolve this tension. We implement and evaluate LAB in a system called Senergy. Developers specify their LAB requirements independent of inference algorithms and sensors. Senergy delivers energy efficient context while meeting the requirements and adapts as hardware changes. We demonstrate LAB's expressiveness by using it to implement 22 context sensing algorithms for four types of context (location, driving, walking, and stationary) and six diverse applications. To demonstrate LAB's energy optimizations, we show often an order of magnitude improvements in energy efficiency on applications compared to prior approaches. This relatively simple, priority based API, may serve as a blueprint for future API design in an increasingly complex design space that must tradeoff latency, accuracy, and efficiency to meet application needs and attain portability across evolving, sensor-rich, heterogeneous, and power constrained hardware.

TI Test-and-Adapt: An Approach for Improving Service Interchangeability
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB Service-oriented applications do not fully benefit from standard APIs yet, and many applications fail to use interchangeably all the services that implement a standard service API. This article presents an approach to develop adaptation strategies that improve service interchangeability for service-oriented applications based on standard APIs. In our approach, an adaptation strategy consists of sets of parametric adaptation plans (called test-and-adapt plans), which execute test cases to reveal the occurrence of interchangeability problems, and activate runtime adaptors according to the test results. Throughout this article, we formalize the structure of the parametric test-and-adapt plans and of their execution semantics, present an algorithm for identifying correct execution orders through sets of test-and-adapt plans, provide empirical evidence of the occurrence of interchangeability problems for sample applications and services, and discuss the effectiveness of the approach in terms of avoided failures, runtime overheads and development costs.

TI A common API for delivering services over multi-vendor cloud resources
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB The increasing pace of evolution in business computing services leads enterprises to outsource secondary operations that are not part of their core business. The cloud computing market has been growing over the past few years and, consequently, many cloud companies are now offering a rich set of features to their consumers. Unfortunately, those cloud players have created new services with different APIs, which imply that cloud-oriented applications might be instantiated in one single cloud provider. This scenario is not desirable to the IT industry because their applications will become provider-dependent. In this paper we present a platform that allows applications to interoperate with distinct cloud providers' services using a normalized interface. The proposed approach provides a common API that minimizes the present deficit of cloud API standardization and provides secure and redundant services allocation. Moreover, services from different cloud providers can be combined and decorated with additional functionalities like, for instance, redundancy and ciphering on-the-fly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

It is the first system to distribute data at global scale and support externally-consistent distributed transactions. This article describes how Spanner is structured, its feature set, the rationale underlying various design decisions, and a novel time API that exposes clock uncertainty. This API and its implementation are critical to supporting external consistency and a variety of powerful features: nonblocking reads in the past, lock-free snapshot transactions, and atomic schema changes, across all of Spanner.

TI LLAMA: A Cache/Storage Subsystem for Modern Hardware
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
AB LLAMA is a subsystem designed for new hardware environments that supports an API for page-oriented access methods, providing both cache and storage management. Caching (CL) and storage (SL) layers use a common mapping table that separates a page's logical and physical location. CL supports data updates and management updates (e.g., for index re-organization) via latch-free compare-and-swap atomic state changes on its mapping table. SL uses the same mapping table to cope with page location changes produced by log structuring on every page flush. To demonstrate LLAMA's suitability, we tailored our latch-free Bw-tree implementation to use LLAMA. The Bw-tree is a B-tree style index. Layered on LLAMA, it has higher performance and scalability using real workloads compared with BerkeleyDB's B-tree, which is known for good performance.

TI Automatic Topic Ontology Construction Using Semantic Relations from
   WordNet and Wikipedia
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB Due to the explosive growth of web technology, a huge amount of information is available as web resources over the Internet. Therefore, in order to access the relevant content from the web resources effectively, considerable attention is paid on the semantic web for efficient knowledge sharing and interoperability. Topic ontology is a hierarchy of a set of topics that are interconnected using semantic relations, which is being increasingly used in the web mining techniques. Reviews of the past research reveal that semiautomatic ontology is not capable of handling high usage. This shortcoming prompted the authors to develop an automatic topic ontology construction process. However, in the past many attempts have been made by other researchers to utilize the automatic construction of ontology, which turned out to be challenging due to time, cost and maintenance. In this paper, the authors have proposed a corpus based novel approach to enrich the set of categories in the ODP by automatically identifying the concepts and their associated semantic relationship with corpus based external knowledge resources, such as Wikipedia and WordNet. This topic ontology construction approach relies on concept acquisition and semantic relation extraction. A Jena API framework has been developed to organize the set of extracted semantic concepts, while Protege provides the platform to visualize the automatically constructed topic ontology. To evaluate the performance, web documents were classified using SVM classifier based on ODP and topic ontology. The topic ontology based classification produced better accuracy than ODP.

TI The SCF: A Framework for Application Enablement Service Composition
SO BELL LABS TECHNICAL JOURNAL
AB Communication service provider ambitions to profitably leverage their network capabilities, provide novel differentiating services, and potentially even to tap into the talents of global development communities motivates the idea of a flexible service platform and service creation environment. Optimally, the platform should include a multiplicity of enablers that provide convenient programming interfaces to network elements and an environment where those enablers may be woven into composite services. The Service Composition Framework (SCF) for Alcatel-Lucent's Open API Platform is robust and sophisticated middleware for hosting composite services. Such services can be created by third parties via an innovative service creation environment. The SCF is built on a core of open source software, with the valuable addition of a maintenance infrastructure, and a suite of services, enablers, policies, and utilities to support new services. This paper also describes the SCF's run-time hosting of composite services, their configuration, and their creation using the companion SCE. (c) 2013 Alcatel-Lucent.

TI E-ETL: Framework for Managing Evolving ETL Workflows
SO FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING AND DECISION SCIENCES
AB Data warehouses integrate external data sources (EDSs), which very often change their data structures (schemas). In many cases, such changes cause an erroneous execution of an already deployed ETL workflow. Structural changes of EDSs are frequent, therefore an automatic reparation of an ETL workflow, after such changes, is of a high importance. This paper presents a framework, called E-ETL, for handling the evolution of an ETL layer. Detection of changes in EDSs causes a reparation of the fragment of ETL workflow which interacts with the changed EDSs. The proposed framework was developed as a module external to a standard commercial or open-source ETL engine, accessing the engine by means of API. The innovation of this framework consists in: (1) the algorithms for semi-automatic reparation of an ETL workflow and (2) its ability to interact with various ETL engines that provide API.

TI AIP: a tool for flexible and transparent data management
SO SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Existing data management tools have some limitations such as restrictions to specific file systems or shortage of transparence to applications. In this paper, we present a new data management tool called AIR which is implemented via the standard data management API, and hence it supports multiple file systems and makes data management operations transparent to applications. First, AIP provides centralized policy-based data management for controlling the placement of files in different storage tiers. Second, AIP uses differentiated collections of file states to improve the execution efficiency of data management policies, with the help of the caching mechanism of file states. Third, AIP also provides a resource arbitration mechanism for controlling the rate of initiated data management operations. Our results from representative experiments demonstrate that AIP has the ability to provide high performance, to introduce low management overhead, and to have good scalability.

TI Automated API Property Inference Techniques
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Frameworks and libraries offer reusable and customizable functionality through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Correctly using large and sophisticated APIs can represent a challenge due to hidden assumptions and requirements. Numerous approaches have been developed to infer properties of APIs, intended to guide their use by developers. With each approach come new definitions of API properties, new techniques for inferring these properties, and new ways to assess their correctness and usefulness. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of over a decade of research on automated property inference for APIs. Our survey provides a synthesis of this complex technical field along different dimensions of analysis: properties inferred, mining techniques, and empirical results. In particular, we derive a classification and organization of over 60 techniques into five different categories based on the type of API property inferred: unordered usage patterns, sequential usage patterns, behavioral specifications, migration mappings, and general information.

TI Eliminate Evading Analysis Tricks in Malware using Dynamic Slicing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SECURITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB In order to be a long time alive, modern malware often make anti-emulation check after launched for evading dynamic analysis. Malware authors gain fingerprint information of target environment through several API to detect whether their creations are running in monitored state or not. If an emulated analysis environment is detected, the malware will change its running to avoid malicious behavior exposing. The existing approaches are based on trace matching with a intuition that, given the same inputs, the execution of a program should be the same in simulated analysis environment and on a real hardware reference system. However those approaches are too fine-grained to be inefficient.
   In this paper we propose an approach to deal with anti-emulation using instruction traces and dynamic slicing. With a difference from trace matching solutions presented in existing references, our approach is performed on one instruction trace derived from our dynamic analysis platform. We evaluate our approach with 189 malware samples collected in the wild. The experience shows that our proposed approach can spot efAPI used for anti-emulation check in an efficient way.

TI A consensus modeling approach to update a spectroscopic calibration
SO CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS
AB A spectroscopic calibration model is only valid to predict samples within the current calibration sample space span. This space is characterized by the calibration spectral variances set by the sample matrix properties and instrument environment (the primary conditions). Prediction samples commonly have new spectral variances (the secondary conditions) and dynamic model maintenance is needed. Previous work has shown that variants of Tikhonov regularization (TR) are capable of accomplishing this task by updating the primary model with only a few secondary condition samples (a current standardization set). An aspect of the TR variants is a weight (tuning parameter) for the small standardization set augmented to the full primary calibration sample set. In past work, this tuning parameter in combination with a second regularization parameter is graphically assessed to select a single updated model. Developed in this paper is a novel graphical consensus approach that selects a family of models across a range of tuning parameter values. Thresholds on model merit values are used to identify appropriate updated models. Model merits can be R-2, intercept, and slope for the primary calibration and standardization sets, root mean square error (RMSE) terms, and/or the model vector magnitude. Two previously used TR variants are studied. One TR modification requires analyte reference values and the other variation uses no reference values. The TR consensus approach with reference samples is applied to updating a laboratory based near infrared (NIR) primary calibration model to predict active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) tablet concentrations from NIR spectra measured on tablets produced in the full production secondary conditions. The TR approach without reference samples updates a NIR pure component analyte model at one temperature to new temperature dependent sample matrix conditions. In both studies, consensus models predict equivalently to individual models selected by previously developed graphical approaches. The consensus approach is also applied to model updating by partial least squares (PLS). While PLS and TR predict similarly, PLS can be limited by the discrete factorization process. The described consensus approach is also applicable to just primary calibration. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Testing of embedded devices is a big challenge in a changing and competitive technical environment, as testing of one embedded application is not similar to another. For testing of embedded system generic middleware, device driver and operating systems are required and ruled over target hardware for the execution. Companies developing products based on embedded systems understand the fact that high quality and unique application software plays an important role in the differentiation of their products from their competitors. This generic interface can test the various services of the embedded system, and supports unit test and integration test which are based system testing technology. By using generic interface in the target embedded platform to do testing the results show that our constructed testing interface is workable. This paper, in the perspective of software solution, presents a generic API for testing the target embedded system.

AB Due to various considerations, software vendors often translate their applications from one programming language to another, either manually or with the support of translation tools. Both these scenarios require translation of many call sites of API elements (i.e., classes, methods, and fields of API libraries). API mapping relations, either acquired by experienced programmers or already incorporated in translation tools, are much valuable in the translation process, since they describe mapping relations between source API elements and their equivalent target API elements. However, in an API mapping relation, a source API element and its target API elements may have behavioral differences, and such differences could lead to defects in the translated code. So far, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no previous study for exposing or understanding such differences. In this paper, we make the first attempt to expose and analyze behavioral differences in cross-language API mapping relations. From our result, we summarize eight findings and their implications that can improve effectiveness of translation tools, and also assist programmers in understanding the differences between mapped API elements of different languages during the translation process. Some exposed behavioral differences can indicate defects in translation tools, and four such new defects were confirmed by the developers of those tools.

AB Recent studies of mobile Web trends show the continued explosion of mobile-friend content. However, the wide number and heterogeneity of mobile devices poses several challenges for Web programmers, who want automatic delivery of context and adaptation of the content to mobile devices. Hence, the device detection phase assumes an important role in this process. In this chapter, the authors compare the most used approaches for mobile device detection. Based on this study, they present an architecture for detecting and delivering uniform m-Learning content to students in a Higher School. The authors focus mainly on the XML device capabilities repository and on the REST API Web Service for dealing with device data. In the former, the authors detail the respective capabilities schema and present a new caching approach. In the latter, they present an extension of the current API for dealing with it. Finally, the authors validate their approach by presenting the overall data and statistics collected through the Google Analytics service, in order to better understand the adherence to the mobile Web interface, its evolution over time, and the main weaknesses.

AB This paper describes and demonstrates a distributional semantic search service infrastructure for Linked Dataspaces. The center of the approach relies on the use of a distributional semantics infrastructure to provide semantic search and query services over data for users and applications, improving data accessibility over the Dataspace. By accessing the services through a REST API, users can semantically index and search over data using the distributional semantic knowledge embedded in the reference corpus. The use of distributional semantic models, which rely on the automatic extraction from large corpora, supports a comprehensive and approximative semantic matching mechanism with a low associated adaptation cost for the inclusion of new data sources.

TI Data Extraction from Online Social Networks Using Application
   Programming Interface in a Multi Agent System Approach
SO TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE XI
SE Lecture Notes in Computer Science
AB In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) have attracted a significant increased number of users. New methods for extracting data are required to deal with the real time changes of a huge amount of personal information in OSNs. In the past, we implemented a parser as centralized system to retrieve information from OSN profiles source web pages. One of the drawbacks was that the parser had to be updated to reflect the changes in the profiles' structure. In this paper, we extend our previous work that proposed Online Social Network Retrieval System (OSNRS) to decentralize the retrieving information process from OSN. The novelty of OSNRS, which is based on a Multi Agent System (MAS), is its ability to monitor profiles continuously. The new addition involves replacing the parser with the Application Programming Interface (API) tool to enable OSNRS to be integrated with services that are supported by OSN providers in the absence of the profiles source web page. Also, new algorithms alongside case studies are presented to improve OSNRS. The experimental work shows that using API and MAS simplifies and speeds up tracking the history of OSN profiles. Moreover, combining them with text mining helps us further to understand the dynamic behaviour of OSNs users.

AB The Blackhole Exploit Kit (BEK) has been called the "Toyota Camry" of exploit kits - cheap, readily available and reliable. According to some estimates, it was used to enable the majority of malware infections in 2012. One major infection vector for BEK is through Twitter. In this paper, we analyze over two months of Twitter data from May through July of 2012 and identify user accounts affected by BEK. Based on reports that BEK infected tweets containing the string "It's you on photo?" were being used to lure victims to BEK infected sites, we identified matching messages and analyzed the associated accounts. We then identified a wider range of message types associated with BEK infection and developed an automated mechanism for identifying infectious accounts - both accounts that were created specifically for malware distribution and legitimate accounts that began distributing malware after the owner's system was infected. Specifically, we find that BEK infectious accounts are characterized by tweets with an entropy lower than 4.5, tweets that are sent using the Mobile Web API and tweets containing an embedded URL. We present an automated method for isolating the point at which an account becomes infectious based on changes in the entropy of tweets from the account.

AB On the Android platform, antivirus software suffers from significant deficiencies. Due to platform limitations, it cannot access or monitor an Android device's file system, or dynamic behavior of installed apps. This includes the down-loading of malicious files after installation, and other file system alterations. That has grave consequences for device security, as any app - even without openly malicious code in its package file - can still download and execute malicious files without any danger of being detected by antivirus software. In this paper, we present a proposal for an antivirus interface to be added to the Android API. It allows for three primary operations: (1) on-demand file system scanning and traversal, (2) on-change file system monitoring, (3) a set of basic operations that allow for scanning of arbitrary file system objects without disclosing their contents. This interface can enable Android antivirus software to deploy techniques for malware recognition similar to those of desktop antivirus systems. The proposed measures comply with Android's security architecture and user data privacy is maintained. Through our approach, antivirus software on the Android platform would reach a level of effectiveness significantly higher than currently, and comparable to that of desktop antivirus software.

AB The integration of wireless sensors with mobile phones is gaining momentum as an enabling platform for numerous emerging applications. These mobile systems face dynamic environments where both application requirements and ambient wireless conditions change frequently. Despite the existence of many MAC protocols, none can provide optimal characteristics along multiple dimensions, especially when the conditions are frequently changing. Instead of pursuing a one-MAC-fitall approach we present the Self-Adapting MAC Layer (SAML) that dynamically selects and switches MAC protocols to gain the desired characteristics in response to changes in ambient conditions and application requirements. SAML comprises (1) a Reconfigurable MAC Architecture (RMA) that can switch to different MAC protocols at run time and (2) a learning-based MAC Selection Engine that selects the protocol most suitable for the current condition and requirements. To the application SAML appears as a traditional MAC layer and realizes its benefits through a simple API for the mobile applications. We have implemented SAML in TinyOS 2.x and built three prototypes containing up to five MACs. We evaluate the system in controlled tests and real-world environments using a new gateway device that integrates a 802.15.4 radio with Android phones. Our experimental results show that SAML can effectively adapt MAC layer behavior to meet varying application requirements in dynamic environments through judicious selection and efficient switching of MAC protocols.

AB Context provisioning refers to the trend of gathering, transporting and processing context in order to promote context awareness in Future Internet services. Context awareness enables services to become adaptive, personalized, and accessible in dynamically changing environments. In various scenarios of Internet of things (IoT), connected objects shall be able to negotiate and adapt to their environment. Consequently, the context awareness is an essential feature for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) platforms in order to realize the IoT and enable the management of Context providers (connected objects) and Context information. This paper proposed an abstraction layer to interface ETSI compatible M2M platforms with NGSI Context Management standards interface. The aim of this approach is to promote M2M services adaptation to the ambient environment.

AB Microblog has already been one of the most popular communication channels on the Internet, and also has become the third part of the public opinion source in China. This paper describes the behavior of browsing messages in microblog to calculate the probability of a message to be browsed after releasing and proposed an epidemic model to explain how a rumor gets spread among followers with the influence of different rumor refuting measures. We investigate the evolution of retweeting behavior by gathering data through Sina API. By establishing a human dynamics model for deducing retweeting behavior, the result reveals that the distribution of the probability of a message to be browsed over time presents power-law characters. This indicates that the messages are time-bound, which offers suggestions for message releasing of Micro-blogging Marketing. As for the propagation of rumor, we chose a specific rumor and firstly process its retweet count under the consideration of microblog users' active periods based on empirical analysis. Then, an improved rumor spreading SIR model, which takes the impact of rumor refuting by the affected enterprise, a microblogging opinion leader and microblogging platform into account, is constructed. According to the simulation results, this model shows how these rumor refuting measures influence the propagation of rumor, reflecting the most effective measure to shrink the transmission of rumor via microblog community.

AB Library migration is the process of replacing a third-party library in favor of a competing one during software maintenance. The process of transforming a software source code to become compliant with a new library is cumbersome and error-prone. Indeed, developers have to understand a new Application Programming Interface (API) and search for the right replacements for the functions they use from the old library. As the two libraries are independent, the functions may have totally different structures and names, making the search of mappings very difficult. To assist the developers in this difficult task, we introduce an approach that analyzes source code changes from software projects that already underwent a given library migration to extract mappings between functions. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on several library migrations performed on the Java open source software projects.

AB Heavy usage of third-party libraries is almost mandatory in modern software systems. The knowledge of these libraries is generally scattered across the development team. When a development or a maintenance task involving specific libraries arises, finding the relevant experts would simplify its completion. However there is no automatic approach to identify these experts. In this article we propose LIBTIC, a search engine of library experts automatically populated by mining software repositories. We show that LIBTIC finds relevant experts of common Java libraries among the GitHub developers. We also illustrate its usefulness through a case study on the Apache HBase project where several maintenance and development use-cases are carried out.

AB A significant percentage of warnings reported by tools to detect coding standard violations are false positives. Thus, there are some works dedicated to provide better rules by mining them from source code history, analyzing bug-fixes or changes between system releases. However, software evolves over time, and during development not only bugs are fixed, but also features are added, and code is refactored. In such cases, changes must be consistently applied in source code to avoid maintenance problems. In this paper, we propose to extract system specific rules by mining systematic changes over source code history, i.e., not just from bug-fixes or system releases, to ensure that changes are consistently applied over source code. We focus on structural changes done to support API modification or evolution with the goal of providing better rules to developers. Also, rules are mined from predefined rule patterns that ensure their quality. In order to assess the precision of such specific rules to detect real violations, we compare them with generic rules provided by tools to detect coding standard violations on four real world systems covering two programming languages. The results show that specific rules are more precise in identifying real violations in source code than generic ones, and thus can complement them.

AB When APIs evolve, clients make corresponding changes to their applications to utilize new or updated APIs. Despite the benefits of new or updated APIs, developers are often slow to adopt the new APIs. As a first step toward understanding the impact of API evolution on software ecosystems, we conduct an in-depth case study of the co-evolution behavior of Android API and dependent applications using the version history data found in github.
   Our study confirms that Android is evolving fast at a rate of 115 API updates per month on average. Client adoption, however, is not catching up with the pace of API evolution. About 28% of API references in client applications are outdated with a median lagging time of 16 months. 22% of outdated API usages eventually upgrade to use newer API versions, but the propagation time is about 14 months, much slower than the average API release interval (3 months). Fast evolving APIs are used more by clients than slow evolving APIs but the average time taken to adopt new versions is longer for fast evolving APIs. Further, API usage adaptation code is more defect prone than the one without API usage adaptation. This may indicate that developers avoid API instability.

AB Software ecosystems consist of multiple software projects, often interrelated each other by means of dependency relations. When one project undergoes changes, other projects may decide to upgrade the dependency. For example, a project could use a new version of another project because the latter has been enhanced or subject to some bug-fixing activities. This paper reports an exploratory study aimed at observing the evolution of the Java subset of the Apache ecosystem, consisting of 147 projects, for a period of 14 years, and resulting in 1,964 releases. Specifically, we analyze (i) how dependencies change over time; (ii) whether a dependency upgrade is due to different kinds of factors, such as different kinds of API changes or licensing issues; and (iii) how an upgrade impacts on a related project. Results of this study help to comprehend the phenomenon of library/component upgrade, and provides the basis for a new family of recommenders aimed at supporting developers in the complex (and risky) activity of managing library/component upgrade within their software projects.

AB A case study of three open source systems undergoing large adaptive maintenance tasks is presented. The adaptive maintenance task involves migrating each system to a new version of a third party API. The changes to support the migration were spread out over multiple years for each system. The first two systems are both part of KDE, namely KOffice and Extragear/graphics. The adaptive maintenance task, for both systems, involves migrating to a new version of Qt. The third system is OpenSceneGraph that underwent a migration to a new version of OpenGL. The case study involves sifting through tens of thousands of commits to identify only those commits involved in the specific adaptive maintenance task. The object is to develop a data set that will be used for developing automated methods to identify/characterize adaptive maintenance commits.

AB Plenty of open source libraries and frameworks are available for developers these days for reuse in their projects. However the difficulty in finding and reusing the correct API among the hundreds of available APIs far outweighs the advantage of saving time. The problem is acute in enterprise codebase. Online forums like StackOverflow are no help for enterprise source code as they are closed in nature. We have developed a tool called E-Xplore that addresses this issue by letting the programmers search in large source codebase and browse them effectively. The tool also provides related artifacts in the form of result clustering. We evaluated E-Xplore with other tools via user study with developers working on an enterprise banking system with more than 10 million lines of code. A set of common tasks was given to the developers with and without the tool. We observed that the tool offered appreciable time and effort benefits in large scale software system development and maintenance. In this paper we describe the tool and its features which help develop and maintain source code effectively.

AB Developers often receive many feature requests. To implement these features, developers can leverage various methods from third party libraries. In this work, we propose an automated approach that takes as input a textual description of a feature request. It then recommends methods in library APIs that developers can use to implement the feature. Our recommendation approach learns from records of other changes made to software systems, and compares the textual description of the requested feature with the textual descriptions of various API methods. We have evaluated our approach on more than 500 feature requests of Axis2/Java, CXF, Hadoop Common, HBase, and Struts 2. Our experiments show that our approach is able to recommend the right methods from 10 libraries with an average recall-rate@5 of 0.690 and recall-rate@10 of 0.779 respectively. We also show that the state-of-the-art approach by Chan et al., that recommends API methods based on precise text phrases, is unable to handle feature requests.

AB As real systems become larger and more complex, the use of simulator frameworks grows in our research community. By leveraging them, users can focus on the major aspects of their algorithm, run in-siclo experiments (i.e., simulations), and thoroughly analyze results, even for a large-scale environment without facing the complexity of conducting in-vivo studies (i.e., on real testbeds). Since nowadays the virtual machine (VM) technology has become a fundamental building block of distributed computing environments, in particular in cloud infrastructures, our community needs a full-fledged simulation framework that enables us to investigate large-scale virtualized environments through accurate simulations. To be adopted, such a framework should provides easy-to-use APIs, close to the real ones and preferably fully compatible with those of an existing popular simulation framework.
   In this paper, we present the current implementation status of a highly-scalable and versatile simulation framework supporting VM environments, extending a widely-used, open-source framework, SimGrid. Our simulation framework allows users to launch hundreds of thousands of VMs on their simulation programs and control VMs in the same manner as in the real world (e.g., suspend/resume and migrate). Users can execute computation and communication tasks on physical machines (PMs) and VMs through the same SimGrid API, which will provide a seamless migration path to IaaS simulations for thousands of SimGrid users. Preliminary validations showed that the resource sharing mechanism of the VM support worked correctly.

AB Skillful design remains one of the critical success factors in long-lived software projects. Design fundamentals have been established and are pretty stable. How do we teach design in-the-large to equip our graduates with design skills relevant to a plethora of changing software technologies and emerging new application domains? Today programs are built on top of functionalities provided by software platforms. Most often, developers extend existing systems rather than develop from scratch. Programming with application program interfaces (API) that allow newly written code to call middleware or existing application software has become a norm in software industries. While the details of API mechanisms heavily depend on a specific platform or application, the principles behind API design are universal, and can be taught in project courses designed for that purpose. Working knowledge of API design principles helps students faster adapt to new and changing technologies. In the paper, we describe a teaching methodology and 10 years of experiences teaching advanced design in a team-based software engineering project course. Our course builds around fundamental concepts in API design and use.

AB MapReduce is a programming model which allows the processing of vast amounts of data in parallel, on a large number of machines. It is particularly well suited to static or slow changing set of data since the execution time of a job is usually high. However, in practice data-centers collect data at fast rates which makes it very difficult to maintain up-to-date results. To address this challenge, we propose in this paper a generic mechanism for dealing with dynamic data in MapReduce frameworks. Long-standing MapReduce jobs, called continuous Jobs, are automatically re-executed to process new incoming data at a minimum cost. We present a simple and clean API which integrates nicely with the standard MapReduce model. Furthermore, we describe cHadoop, an implementation of our approach based on Hadoop which does not require modifications to the source code of the original framework. Thus, cHadoop can quickly be ported to any new version of Hadoop. We evaluate our proposal with two standard MapReduce applications (WordCount and WordCount-N-Count), and one real world application (RDF Query) on real datasets. Our evaluations on clusters ranging from 5 to 40 nodes demonstrate the benefit of our approach in terms of execution time and ease of use.

AB Eclipse guidelines distinguish between two types of interfaces provided to third-party developers, i.e., APIs and non-APIs. APIs are stable and supported, while non-APIs are unstable, unsupported and discouraged as they are subject to arbitrary change or removal without notice. In our previous work, we found that despite the discouragement of Eclipse, the use of non-APIs in Eclipse third-party plug-ins (ETPs) is not uncommon. Furthermore, we found that these non-APIs are the main cause of ETP incompatibilities in forthcoming releases of the Eclipse.
   In the current work we conducted a survey aiming at understanding why do the ETP developers use non-APIs. We have observed that developers with a level of education of up to master degree have a tendency not to read product manuals/guidelines. Furthermore, while for less experienced developers instability of the non-APIs overshadows their benefits, more experienced developers prefer to enjoy the benefits of non-APIs despite the instability problem. Finally, we have observed that there are no significant differences between Open Source and commercial Eclipse products in terms of awareness of Eclipse guidelines and interfaces, Eclipse product size and updating of Eclipse product in the new SDK releases.

AB Sustainable management of large amounts of research data is gaining in importance for research projects all over the world. The European project DARIAH aims to address this topic for the arts and humanities community.
   The DARIAH Bit Preservation, as a part of an archiving system for the arts and humanities, allows for a high performance, sustainable, and distributed storage of research data as basis of virtual research environments. A great challenge in designing such a service is to provide a standardized, consistent yet easy-to-use API for accessing the data that remains stable even if backend technology changes over time.
   As a solution, this paper presents the RESTful API of the DARIAH Bit Preservation which includes an administrative extension, and which is secured by an Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI) based on SAML. An exemplary implementation illustrates that the API offers distributed access by usage of the HTTP protocol and is able to handle a high number of files. Data transfer rates of up to 45 MB/s were achieved for uploading large files in the local network.

TI Comparison and evaluation of source code mining tools and techniques: A
   qualitative approach
SO INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS
AB Program source code substantially is structured and contains semantically rich programming constructs such as variables, functions, data structures, and program structures which indicate patterns. Mining source code by using different data mining techniques to extract the valuable hidden patterns is the new revolution in software engineering. Over last decade many tools and techniques have been proposed by researcher to extract pertinent information and uncover relationships and trends from source code about a particular characteristic of Software Engineering (SE) tasks. These efforts have resulted in wide range of research body but currently there is no comprehensive overview exists.
   This paper surveys the tools and techniques which rely only on data mining methods to determine patterns from source code in context of programming, bug detection, maintenance, program understanding and software reuse. The work provides comparison and evaluation of the current state-of-the-art source code mining tools and techniques, and organizes the large amount of information into a coherent conceptual way. Thus the survey provides researchers with a concise overview of source code mining techniques and assists practitioners the selection of appropriate techniques for their work.
   The result of this review shows existing studies focus on one specific pattern being mined from source code such as special kind of bug detection. Thus, there is a need of multiple tools to test and find potential information from software which increase cost and time of development. Hence there is a strong need of tool which helps in developing quality software by automatically detecting different kind of bugs and generates relevant API code automatically to help in decreasing overall software development time.

TI Catching the Behavioral Differences between Multiple Executions for
   Malware Detection
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB As the number of new malware has increased explosively, traditional malware detection approaches based on pattern matching have been less effective. Therefore, it is important to develop a detection method which relies on not signatures but characteristic behaviors of malware. Recently, malware authors have been embedding functions for countermeasure against malware analyses and detections into malware. Accordingly, modern malware often changes their runtime behaviors in each execution to tolerate against malware analyses and detections. For example, when malware copies itself on a file system, it can randomly determine its file name for avoiding the detections. Another example is that when malware tries to connect its command and control server, it randomly chooses a domain name from a hard-coded domain name list to avoid being blocked by a static blacklist of malicious domain names. We assume that such evasive behaviors are unnecessary for benign software. Therefore the behaviors can be the clues to distinguish malware from benign software. In this paper, we propose a novel behavior-based malware detection method which focuses attention on such characteristics. Our proposed method conducts dynamic analysis on an executable file multiple times in same sandbox environment so as to obtain plural lists of API call sequences and plural traffic logs, and then compares the lists and the logs to find the difference between the multiple executions. In. the experiments with 5,697 malware samples and 819 benign software samples, we can detect about 70% malware samples and the false positive rate is about 1%. In addition, we can detect about 50% malware samples which were not detected by each Anti-Virus Software engine. Therefore we confirm the possibility the proposed method may be able to improve the accuracy of malware detection utilizing in combination with other existing methods.

AB Data warehouses integrate external data sources (EDSs), which very often change their data structures (schemas). In many cases, such changes cause an erroneous execution of an already deployed ETL workflow. Structural changes of EDSs are frequent, therefore an automatic reparation of an ETL workflow, after such changes, is of a high importance. This paper presents a framework for handling the evolution of an ETL layer - E-ETL. Detection of changes in EDSs causes a reparation of the fragment of ETL workflow which interacts with the changed EDS. The proposed framework was developed as a module external to an ETL engine, accessing the engine by means of API. The innovation of this framework are algorithms for semi-automatic reparation of an ETL workflow.

TI Identifying and Summarizing Systematic Code Changes via Rule Inference
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Programmers often need to reason about how a program evolved between two or more program versions. Reasoning about program changes is challenging as there is a significant gap between how programmers think about changes and how existing program differencing tools represent such changes. For example, even though modification of a locking protocol is conceptually simple and systematic at a code level, diff extracts scattered text additions and deletions per file. To enable programmers to reason about program differences at a high level, this paper proposes a rule-based program differencing approach that automatically discovers and represents systematic changes as logic rules. To demonstrate the viability of this approach, we instantiated this approach at two different abstraction levels in Java: first at the level of application programming interface (API) names and signatures, and second at the level of code elements (e.g., types, methods, and fields) and structural dependences (e.g., method-calls, field-accesses, and subtyping relationships). The benefit of this approach is demonstrated through its application to several open source projects as well as a focus group study with professional software engineers from a large e-commerce company.

AB Most of the work on VM network performance has focused so far on bulk TCP traffic, which covers classical applications of virtualization. Completely new "paravirtualized devices" (Xenfront, VIRTIO, vmxnet) have been designed and implemented to improve network throughput.
   We expect virtualization to become widely used also for different workloads: packet switching devices and middle-boxes, Software Defined Networks, etc.. These applications involve very high packet rates that are problematic not only for the hypervisor (which emulates network interfaces) but also for the host itself (which switches packets between guests and physical NICs).
   In this paper we provide three main results. First, we demonstrate how rates of millions of packets per second can be achieved even within VMs, with limited but targeted modifications on device drivers, hypervisors and the host's virtual switch. Secondly, we show that emulation of conventional NICs (e. g., Intel e1000) is perfectly capable of achieving such packet rates, without requiring completely different device models. Finally, we provide sets of modifications suitable for different use cases (acting only on the guest, or only on the host, or on both) which can improve the network throughput of a VM by 20 times or more.
   These results are important because they enable a new set of applications within virtual machines. In particular, we achieve guest-to-guest UDP speeds of over 1 Mpps with short frames (and 6 Gbit/s with 1500-byte frames) using a conventional e1000 device, and socket-based sender/receivers. This matches the speed of the OS on bare metal. Furthermore, we reach over 5 Mpps when guests use the netmap API.
   Our work requires only small changes to device drivers (about 100 lines, both for FreeBSD and Linux version of e1000), similarly small modifications to the hypervisor (we have a QEMU prototype available) and the use of the VALE switch as a network backend. Relevant changes are being incorporated and/or distributed as external patches for FreeBSD, QEMU and Linux.

AB With the decreasing Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of high performance computing systems, process failure has become a normal phenomenon rather than an exception. The failures in high frequency lead to fault tolerance, a key feature of high performance applications. To provide fault tolerance interfaces for active message programs, this paper proposes a novel model called event-driven fault tolerance. The model converts each detected process failure into an event containing detailed failure information of the execution context, and then schedules the event up to application layer by executing user-directed event handlers to drive the program to recover from faults. Based on events, the model can provide applications with dynamic process groups and fault tolerant communication interfaces. We present an implementation of the model called EDFT (Event Driven Fault Tolerance) and describe its architecture, principle, components and application programming interfaces (API). To evaluate this model, we incorporate EDFT into a scientific application, PreStack Depth Migration (PSDM). Experiments are conducted by injecting various kinds of faults into PSDM when it is running. Experimental results show that for active message programs that demand high performance, event-driven fault tolerance model promises strong robustness, low overhead and high scalability.

AB Traditional petascale applications, such as QMCPack, can scale their computations to completely utilize modern supercomputers like Titan, but they cannot scale their I/O. To preserve scalability, scientists cannot save data at the granularity needed to enable scientific discovery and are forced to use large intervals between two checkpoint calls. In this paper, we work to increase the granularity of the I/O in QMCPack simulations without increasing the I/O associated overhead or compromising the scalability of the simulations. Our solution redesigns the I/O algorithms used by QMCPack to gather finer-grained data at high frequencies and integrate the ADIOS API to select effective I/O methods without major code changes. The extension of a tool such as Skel to mimic the variable I/O in QMCPack allows us to predict the I/O performance of the code when using ADIOS methods at the petascale. We show how I/O libraries like ADIOS allow us to increase the amount of scientific data extracted from QMCPack simulations at the granularity desired by the scientists while keeping the I/O overhead below 10%. We also show how the impact of checkpoint I/O for the QMCPack code using ADIOS is below 5% when using preventive tactics for checkpointing at the petascale and beyond.

AB Although virtual machine (VM) placement problem has been an active research area over the past decade, the research community is still looking for an open simulation framework that can simulate in an accurate as well as scalable manner VM operations including live migrations. Existing frameworks leverage a naive migration model that considers neither memory update operations nor resource sharing contention, resulting in an underestimate of both the duration of a live migration and the size of migration traffic.
   In this paper, we propose a simulation framework of virtualized distributed systems with the first class support of live migration operations. We developed a resource share calculation mechanism for VMs and a live migration model implementing the precopy migration algorithm of Qemu/KVM. We extended a widely used simulation toolkit, SimGrid, which allows users to simulate large-scale distributed systems by using user-friendly programming API. Through experiments, we confirmed that our simulation framework correctly reproduced live migration behaviors of the real world under various conditions. Through a first use case, we also confirmed that it is possible to conduct large-scale simulations of complex virtualized workloads upon hundred thousands of VMs upon thousands of physical machines (PMs).

AB In this paper, open source and PHP web programming are used to implement dynamic resource allocation in a virtual machine management system for energy saving. We adopted system integrated open source software like KVM and Libvirt API, and energy saving algorithms developed by our own research to construct an energy efficient virtualization management platform in the cloud. From analysis of the experimental results of live migration of virtual machines, we demonstrate that efficient use of hardware resources is realized by the dynamic resource allocation algorithm, and the aim of energy saving is achieved.

AB Cloud computing is now across all the enterprises and they are being benefitted by the low cost and highly available environment. Cloud computing has changed the way industries used to work with all by their own concept. Sharing of resources and availability of on demand computational power has made the work easier for the smaller and large enterprises both. But the initial estimation for the requirement of the resources and to measure the peak time load or load at non peak hour so that enterprise or a proof of concept can use the cloud optimally was still the problem. Cloud Computing is a service based model and a well defined resource requirement leads to a optimal utilization of the resources. Cloud Simulation is a powerful tool to simulate the exact environment, visualizing the usage patterns and to monitor the load. CloudSim is Cloud Simulation framework that provides all these capabilities and can be used monitor the usage patterns. In this paper we are using CloudSim API [3] to monitor the load patterns of the various users of a web application.

AB Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) for health care allows the access of sensor data anytime, anywhere using standard protocol and Application Program Interface (API). In this paper Open Geo-Spatial Consortium (OGC) standard based remote health monitoring system is proposed that allows integration of sensor and web using standard web based interface. The aim is to provide the data in an open & interoperable manner, and reduce data redundancy. Fixed specification is used for exchange of sensor data globally for all sensor networks. OGC SWEis applicable to different sensor systems including medical sensor networks. A standard format is used to document sensor descriptions and encapsulate data. Sensor data is ported on to cloud which provides scalability, centralized user access, persistent data storage and no infrastructure maintenance cost for heavy volumes of sensitive health data. Decision tree pruning algorithm with high confidence factor is proposed for automatic decision making.

AB The Optimized Neuro Genetic Fast Estimator (ONGFE) is a software tool that allows for embedding system, subsystem, and component failure detection, identification, and prognostics (FDI&P) capability by using Intelligent Software Elements (ISE) based upon Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). With an Application Programming Interface (API), highly innovative algorithms are compiled for efficient distributed intelligence instantiation within embedded systems. The original design had the purpose of providing a real time kernel to deploy health monitoring functions for Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Real Time Monitoring (RTM) systems in a broad variety of applications (such as aerospace, structural, and widely distributed support systems). The ONGFE contains embedded fast and on-line training for designing ANNs to perform several high performance FDI&P functions. A key advantage of this technology is an optimization block based upon pseudogenetic algorithms which compensate for effects due to initial weight values and local minimums without the computational burden of genetic algorithms. The ONGFE also provides a synchronization block for communication with secondary diagnostic modules. The algorithms are designed for a distributed, scalar, and modular deployment. Based on this technology, a scheme for conducting sensor data validation has been embedded in Smart Sensors.

AB Currently, programmers of database applications use standard API and frameworks as artifacts to develop business tiers aimed at integrating the object-oriented and the relational paradigms. These artifacts provide programmers with the necessary services to develop business tiers. In this paper we propose a new architecture based on general Call Level Interfaces from which reusable and Adaptable Business tier Components (ABC) may be developed. Each individual ABC component is able to manage SQL statements of any complexity, deployed at run-time, and also to provide tailored services to each SQL statement. To accomplish this goal, the only requirement is that the schema of each deployed SQL statement must be in conformance with one of the pre-defined static schemas (interfaces) of the recipient ABC component. The main contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) to present the new architecture based on general Call Level Interfaces on which ABC components are based, 2) to show that the source code of ABC components may be automatically built by a tool and 3) to present a concrete example of ABC based on JDBC. The main outcome of this paper is the evidence that the presented architecture is an effective approach to build reusable and adaptable business tiers components to bridge the object-oriented and the relational paradigms.

AB The widespread adoption of Android devices has attracted the attention of a growing computer security audience. Fundamental weaknesses and subtle design flaws of the Android architecture have been identified, studied and fixed, mostly through techniques from data-flow analysis, runtime protection mechanisms, or changes to the operating system. This paper complements this research by developing a framework for the analysis of Android applications based on typing techniques. We introduce a formal calculus for reasoning on the Android inter-component communication API and a type-and-effect system to statically prevent privilege escalation attacks on well-typed components. Drawing on our abstract framework, we develop a prototype implementation of Lintent, a security type-checker for Android applications integrated with the Android Development Tools suite. We finally discuss preliminary experiences with our tool, which highlight real attacks on existing applications.

SO HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) is an important component of the ITS architecture, that enables Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications. GeoNet project brought the IVC one step further by enabling transparent IP connectivity between vehicles and the infrastructure. Specifications produced by the GeoNet project have been incorporated into several ETSI standards, which define the geonetworking protocol layer and the IPv6-over-geonetworking adaptation layer. In this paper, we propose an ETSI complaint geonetworking protocol layer on the well known NCTUns simulation framework. We discuss the architecture of our implementation as well as NCTUns specific issues encountered during the implementation. We believe that, with this contribution, the researchers are provided with a scalable and flexible framework with Berkeley socket API access to applications and SQL based performance logging for post simulation evaluations.

TI Parallel Rendering Mechanism for Graphics Programming on Multicore
   Processors
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID AND HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING
AB The present day technological advancement has resulted in multiple core processors coming into desktops, handhelds, servers and workstations. This is because the present day applications and users demand huge computing power and interactivity. Both of these reasons have resulted in a total design shift in the way the processors are designed and developed. However the change in the hardware has not been accompanied with the change in the way the software has to be written for these multicore processors. In this paper, we intend to provide the integration of OpenGL programs on a platform which supports multicore processors. The paper would result in clear understanding how graphics pipelines can be implemented on multi-core processors to achieve higher computational speeds up with highest thread granularity. The impacts of using too much parallelism are also discussed. An OpenMP API for the thread scheduling of parallel task is discussed in this paper. The tool Intel VTune Performance Analyzer is used to find the hotspots and for software optimization. Comparing both the serial and parallel execution of graphics code shows encouraging results and it has been found that the increase in frame rate has resulted due to parallel programming techniques.

AB When a user views an archived page using the archive's user interface (UI), the user selects a datetime to view from a list. The archived web page, if available, is then displayed. From this display, the web archive UI attempts to simulate the web browsing experience by smoothly transitioning between archived pages. During this process, the target datetime changes with each link followed; drifting away from the datetime originally selected. When browsing sparsely-archived pages, this nearly-silent drift can be many years in just a few clicks. We conducted 200,000 acyclic walks of archived pages, following up to 50 links per walk, comparing the results of two target datetime policies. The Sliding Target policy allows the target datetime to change as it does in archive UIs such as the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The Sticky Target policy, represented by the Memento API, keeps the target datetime the same throughout the walk. We found that the Sliding Target policy drift increases with the number of walk steps, number of domains visited, and choice (number of links available). However, the Sticky Target policy controls temporal drift, holding it to less than 30 days on average regardless of walk length or number of domains visited. The Sticky Target policy shows some increase as choice increases, but this may be caused by other factors. We conclude that based on walk length, the Sticky Target policy generally produces at least 30 days less drift than the Sliding Target policy.

TI Streamlining Data for Cross-Platform Web Delivery
SO JOURNAL OF WEB LIBRARIANSHIP
AB Smartphone users expect the presentation of Web sites on their mobile browsers to look and feel like native applications. With the pressure on library Web developers to produce app-like mobile sites, there is often a rush to get a site up without considering the importance of reusing or even restructuring the data driving the Web sites. An additional challenge is the content maintenance required of any Web site, regardless of platform, underscoring the advantage of pulling content from other systems to decrease redundancy. This article highlights case studies from two large research universities, examines how each one is streamlining its data for multiple Web-based platforms, and discusses how to work toward making data more flexible so content is delivered from single source points rather than duplicated on individual delivery platforms.

AB Current multitasking window-based operating systems have adopted an event-driven model to support graphics and user interface control in application programs. But for beginner programmers, the idea of threads and event handling can be difficult to grasp, thus preventing beginner programmers for creating graphics applications, leaving programmers in the early stages to create simple text based console applications. In this research, a non-event driven graphics API for programming education is proposed. By applying the proposed graphics API, programmers can create graphics and real-time user interface applications by simple state-request method calls not requiring any event handling or event call-back methods. The proposed graphics API also supports text based console I/O such as print line and line input, so beginner programmers can shift from console based applications to graphics applications without any paradigm changes.

TI Two Studies of Framework-Usage Templates Extracted from Dynamic Traces
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB Object-oriented frameworks are widely used to develop new applications. They provide reusable concepts that are instantiated in application code through potentially complex implementation steps such as subclassing, implementing interfaces, and calling framework operations. Unfortunately, many modern frameworks are difficult to use because of their large and complex APIs and frequently incomplete user documentation. To cope with these problems, developers often use existing framework applications as a guide. However, locating concept implementations in those sample applications is typically challenging due to code tangling and scattering. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of concept-implementation templates, which summarize the necessary concept-implementation steps and identify them in the sample application code, and a technique, named FUDA, to automatically extract such templates from dynamic traces of sample applications. This paper further presents the results of two experiments conducted to evaluate the quality and usefulness of FUDA templates. The experimental evaluation of FUDA with 14 concepts in five widely used frameworks suggests that the technique is effective in producing templates with relatively few false positives and false negatives for realistic concepts by using two sample applications. Moreover, we observed in a user study with 28 programmers that the use of templates reduced the concept-implementation time compared to when documentation was used.

TI Information Technology as Tools for Cancer Registry and Regional Cancer
   Network Integration
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND
   HUMANS
AB Background. With the publication of large studies from different health systems comparing survival probabilities, cancer registries are increasingly involved in clinical evaluation research. The changing role of registries strictly depends on the integration between the oncology system and proper information technology (IT) tools. IT is fundamental to improving validity and timeliness of data diffusion when both the number of sources linked and the number of variables registered are on the rise. Aims. In this paper, we present a modern web-based management system that allows to integrate different sources, validate and elaborate data thus providing a new evaluation system for the oncology network based on cancer registries. Materials and methods. We developed a Web 2.0 management system for the Umbria Cancer Registry (S.G.RTUP) based on AMPAX technology (Apache, Mysql, PHP, Ajax and XML) and object-oriented programming. ISO/IEC 27001: 2005 standard is followed to ensure security access to the information. The S.G.RTUP architecture is modular and extensible and information consistency is guaranteed by entity-relationship principles. Cancer sites, topology, morphology, and behavior are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases. Classical epidemiological indices for a cancer registry are implemented: incidence, mortality, years of potential life lost, and cumulative risk. S.G.RTUP has tools to prepare data for trend analysis and relative survival analysis. Geographical analysis is also implemented. Results. S.G.RTUP is integrated with the Oncology Network and gives timely epidemiological indices for evaluation of oncological activities. The registration system that we developed can effectively manage different data sources. Automatic importing of routinely available data from pathology archives, screening services, and hospital discharge records will reduce the time needed to produce data and will also allow the expansion of registered information. Several services for data visualization and statistical analysis are implemented. A geographic information system based on Google maps API is used for geolocalization of cases and map plotting of incidence and mortality rates. We implemented Besag York and Mollie's algorithm for real-time smoothed maps. All services can be dynamically performed over a subset of data that the user can select through an innovative filtering system. Discussion and conclusion. IT contributed to shortening all phases of cancer registration, including linkage with external sources, coding, quality control, data management and analysis and publication of results. Integration in the oncology network and secure Web access allowed us to design with clinicians innovative population-based collaborative studies. Our geographic analysis system enables us to develop sophisticated dynamic geostatistic tools.

TI Applying a metadata level for concurrency in wireless sensor networks
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Achieving a clean separation of concerns is a well known approach to improving system adaptability and evolution. We propose to apply this principle to run-time reconfigurable component models for networked embedded systems. By separating configuration properties from runtime component instances, we achieve: (i) improved support for concurrent component use, (ii) optimized resource use, and (iii) reduced effort in runtime configuration management. We demonstrate how this approach can be seamlessly implemented on existing component models for wireless sensor networks without imposing additional constraints and without changes to their API or coordination model. Furthermore, significant memory savings are achieved in concurrent scenarios. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

CL Tucson, AZ
AB Our goal is to develop precise and scalable verification techniques for Java programs that use collections and properties that depend on their content.
   We apply the popular approach of predicate abstraction to Java programs and collections. The main challenge in this context is precise and compact modeling of collections that enables practical verification.
   We define a predicate language for modeling the observable state of Java collections at the interface level. Changes of the state by API methods are captured by weakest preconditions. We adapt existing techniques for construction of abstract programs. Most notably, we designed optimizations based on specific features of the predicate language.
   We evaluated our approach on Java programs that use collections in advanced ways. Our results show that interesting properties, such as consistency between multiple collections, can be verified using our approach. The properties are specified using logic formulas that involve predicates introduced by our language.

   Interposition
SO ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES

   Languages and Applications
CY OCT 19-26, 2012
CL Tucson, AZ
AB Chaperones and impersonators provide run-time support for interposing on primitive operations such as function calls, array access and update, and structure field access and update. Unlike most interposition support, chaperones and impersonators are restricted so that they constrain the behavior of the interposing code to reasonable interposition, which in practice preserves the abstraction mechanisms and reasoning that programmers and compiler analyses rely on.
   Chaperones and impersonators are particularly useful for implementing contracts, and our implementation in Racket allows us to improve both the expressiveness and the performance of Racket's contract system. Specifically, contracts on mutable data can be enforced without changing the API to that data; contracts on large data structures can be checked lazily on only the accessed parts of the structure; contracts on objects and classes can be implemented with lower overhead; and contract wrappers can preserve object equality where appropriate. With this extension, gradual typing systems, such as Typed Racket, that rely on contracts for interoperation with untyped code can now pass mutable values safely between typed and untyped modules.

TI A practical solution for achieving language compatibility in scripting
   language compilers
SO SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING
AB Although scripting languages have become very popular, even mature scripting language implementations remain interpreted. Several compilers and reimplementations have been attempted, generally focusing on performance.
   Based on our survey of these reimplementations, we determine that there are three important features of scripting languages that are difficult to compile or reimplement. Since scripting languages are defined primarily through the semantics of their original implementations, they often change semantics between releases. They provide C APIs, used both for foreign-function interfaces and to write third-party extensions. These APIs typically have tight integration with the original implementation, and are used to provide large standard libraries, which are difficult to re-use, and costly to reimplement. Finally, they support run-time code generation. These features make it difficult to design a fully compatible compiler.
   We present a technique to support these features in an ahead-of-time compiler for PHP. Our technique uses the original PHP implementation through the provided C API, both in our compiler and in our generated code. We support all of these important scripting language features. Additionally, our approach allows us to automatically support limited future language changes. We present a discussion and performance evaluation of this technique. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI An ontology for managing network services quality
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB The evolution of IF networks to a service-oriented paradigm poses new challenges to service providers regarding the management and auditing of network services. The upward trend in ubiquity, heterogeneity and virtualization of network services and resources demands for a formal and systematic approach to network management tasks.
   In this context, the semantic characterization and modeling of services provided to users is a key component to sustain autonomic service management, service negotiation and configuration. The semantic and formal description of services and resources is also relevant to assist paradigms such as cloud computing, where a large diversity of resources have to be described and managed in a highly dynamic way.
   This paper defines an ontology for multiservice IP networks targeting multiple service management goals, namely: (i) to foster client and service provider interoperability; (ii) to manage network service contracts, promoting the dynamic negotiation between parties; (iii) to access and query SLA/SLSs data on a individual or aggregated basis to assist service provisioning in the network; and (iv) to sustain service monitoring and auditing. A ServiceModel API is provided to take full advantage of the proposed semantic model, allowing Service Management Platforms to access the ontological contents. This ontological development takes advantage of SWRL to discover new knowledge, enriching the possibilities of systems described using this support. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Delimited control in OCaml, abstractly and concretely
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB We describe the first implementation of multi-prompt delimited control operators in OCaml that is direct in that it captures only the needed part of the control stack. The implementation is a library that requires no changes to the OCaml compiler or run-time, so it is perfectly compatible with existing OCaml source and binary code. The library has been in fruitful practical use since 2006.
   We present the library as an implementation of an abstract machine derived by elaborating the definitional machine. The abstract view lets us distill a minimalistic API, scAPI, sufficient for implementing multi-prompt delimited control. We argue that a language system that supports exception and stack-overflow handling supports scAPI. With byte- and native-code OCaml systems as two examples, our library illustrates how to use scAPI to implement multi-prompt delimited control in a typed language. The approach is general and has been used to add multi-prompt delimited control to other existing language systems. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Ontology-Driven Information System Design
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND
   REVIEWS
AB Conventional information systems are built on top of a relational database that requires its data model to be stable. This lack of adaptability is very restrictive for systems that manipulate evolving or heterogenous knowledge. The authors of this paper faced this issue at the time of the development of an information system of structural failures. As knowledge on structural failures is very heterogeneous and dynamic, it is practically impossible to define a stable database schema ahead. The widely accepted alternative to relational databases are semantic web ontologies. However, software developers miss adequate frameworks and design methodologies in this area. This paper tries to fill the gap by proposing a methodology for designing ontology-backed software applications that make the ontology possible to evolve while being exploited by one or more applications at the same time. The methodology relies on a contract between the ontology and the application that is formally expressed in terms of integrity constraints. Violation of the contract means either that the ontology evolved in a way that is incompatible with the particular application or the application produced invalid data. In the first case, the ontology change must either be rolled back, or the application needs to be upgraded. In the second case, the user has to modify entered data to fulfill the contract. Furthermore, this paper elaborates an object ontological mapping, transaction management, and efficient querying API. A reference Java implementation of the methodology and the proof-of-concept application in the civil engineering domain is introduced at the end of the paper.

TI An Efficient Wrapper-based Digital Rights Management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SECURITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB In this paper, we propose a novel digital publication issuing mechanism, which supports business model, and implemented the sys tern. In this mechanism, we adopted API-HOOK to avoid changing habits of customers. However, the properties of digital contents make themselves be easily copied and transferred if there is not any proper protection for them. Hence, it is a critical issue for publication provider to effectively control and distribute their digital publications. Digital Rights Management is a mechanism, which might congregate various techniques to protect the rights of digital publication from copyrights violations. Moreover, Wrapper-based Digital flights Management technique applies encapsulating digital contents by packaging content and monitoring by API-Hook to control and protect them, which provide a way to authenticate users by users' machine serial number or smart card via network. Fiance, users may use the digital contents without changing their digital content player. According to the definition of Digital Rights Management, this paper provides a digital publication issuing mechanism, which supports supordisribution for advertising digital publications effectively and improving development of digital contents.

TI Ring: A unifying meta-model and infrastructure for Smalltalk source code
   analysis tools
SO COMPUTER LANGUAGES SYSTEMS & STRUCTURES
AB Source code management systems record different versions of code. Tool support can then compute deltas between versions. To ease version history analysis we need adequate models to represent source code entities. Now naturally the questions of their definition, the abstractions they use, and the APIs of such models are raised, especially in the context of a reflective system which already offers a model of its own structure.
   We believe that this problem is due to the lack of a powerful code meta-model as well as an infrastructure. In Smalltalk, often several source code meta-models coexist: the Smalltalk reflective API coexists with the one of the Refactoring engine or distributed versioning system such as Monticello or Store. While having specific meta-models is an adequate engineered solution, it multiplies meta-models and it requires more maintenance efforts (e.g., duplication of tests, transformation between models), and more importantly hinders navigation tool reuse when meta-models do not offer polymorphic APIs.
   As a first step to provide an infrastructure to support history analysis, this article presents Ring, a unifying source code meta-model that can be used to support several activities and proposes a unified and layered approach to be the foundation for building an infrastructure for version and stream of change analyses. We re-implemented three tools based on Ring to show that it can be used as the underlying meta-model for remote and off-image browsing, scoping refactoring, and visualizing and analyzing changes. As a future work and based on Ring we will build a new generation of history analysis tools. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Embedded, textual DSLs are often provided as an API wrapped around object-oriented application frameworks to ease framework integration. While literature presents claims that DSL-based application development is beneficial, empirical evidence for this is rare. We present the results of an experiment comparing the complexity of three different object-oriented framework APIs and an embedded, textual DSL. For this comparative experiment, we implemented the same, non-trivial application scenario using these four different APIs. Then, we performed an Object-Points (OP) analysis, yielding indicators for the API complexity specific to each API variant. The main observation for our experiment is that the embedded, textual DSL incurs the smallest API complexity. Although the results are exploratory, as well as limited to the given application scenario and a single embedded DSL, our findings can direct future empirical work. The experiment design is applicable for similar API design evaluations.

TI API2MoL: Automating the building of bridges between APIs and
   Model-Driven Engineering
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: A software artefact typically makes its functionality available through a specialized Application Programming Interface (API) describing the set of services offered to client applications. In fact, building any software system usually involves managing a plethora of APIs, which complicates the development process. In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). where models are the key elements of any software engineering activity, this API management should take place at the model level. Therefore, tools that facilitate the integration of APIs and MDE are clearly needed.
   Objective: Our goal is to automate the implementation of API-MDE bridges for supporting both the creation of models from API objects and the generation of such API objects from models. In this sense, this paper presents the API2MoL approach, which provides a declarative rule-based language to easily write mapping definitions to link API specifications and the metamodel that represents them. These definitions are then executed to convert API objects into model elements or vice versa. The approach also allows both the metamodel and the mapping to be automatically obtained from the API specification (bootstrap process).
   Method: After implementing the API2MoL engine, its correctness was validated using several APIs. Since APIs are normally large, we then developed a tool to implement the bootstrap process, which was also validated.
   Results: We provide a toolkit (language and bootstrap tool) for the creation of bridges between APIs and MDE. The current implementation focuses on Java APIs, although its adaptation to other statically typed object-oriented languages is straightforward. The correctness, expressiveness and completeness of the approach have been validated with the Swing, SWT and JTwitter APIs.
   Conclusion: API2MoL frees developers from having to manually implement the tasks of obtaining models from API objects and generating such objects from models. This helps to manage API models in MDE-based solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Hybrid Ant Colony-Genetic Algorithm (GAAPI) for Global Continuous
   Optimization
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS
AB Many real-life optimization problems often face an increased rank of nonsmoothness (many local minima) which could prevent a search algorithm from moving toward the global solution. Evolution-based algorithms try to deal with this issue. The algorithm proposed in this paper is called GAAPI and is a hybridization between two optimization techniques: a special class of ant colony optimization for continuous domains entitled API and a genetic algorithm (GA). The algorithm adopts the downhill behavior of API (a key characteristic of optimization algorithms) and the good spreading in the solution space of the GA. A probabilistic approach and an empirical comparison study are presented to prove the convergence of the proposed method in solving different classes of complex global continuous optimization problems. Numerical results are reported and compared to the existing results in the literature to validate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed algorithm is shown to be effective and efficient for most of the test functions.

Such interfaces are now becoming common due to API-oriented application development and more sophisticated post-Web2.0 mashups. A significant feature of such interfaces is the need for feedback when parts of the page display are in some way temporarily invalid, or in flux, while potentially slow API calls are responding to requests. AAV extends existing methods such as access-oriented programming and the observer pattern, by including a 'changing' event in addition to the normal 'onChange' to enable intermediate feedback.

AB E-Learning platforms are evolving from monolithic applications with a rigid structure that did not allowed for the exchange of tools or components to applications incorporating service orientation concepts as well as facilitating the dynamic discovery and assembling of e-learning services. Accordingly, the usage of support materials to provide additional guidance to students facilitates the comprehension of learning tasks. Wikipedia is one of the richest sources of human knowledge, encompassing a vast range of topics of all kinds of information, and content, which is in constant change due to its collaborative dynamic nature. The Wikipedia Miner provides a code that can parse a given document identifying main topics and link them to corresponding articles or short definitions from the Wikipedia content. In this paper, we discuss the realization of a reusable Wikipedia Miner service for the e-Learning Computational Cloud (eLC(2)) Platform designed with the J2EE technology and Service-Oriented (V-MVC) model excluding a direct link between the Model and the View. This allows enhancing the Controller as a middleware, removing the dependency and acting as a single point of contact. In the V-MVC design pattern, the Controller is modeled by the compound design pattern of the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) supporting higher privacy of the business logic and higher re-usability Architecture standards. The eLC(2) is also based on an original Virtual Model-View-Controller of application components. In this framework, Wikipedia Miner services were prototyped as an Application Engine that wraps the logic of the Wikipedia Miner API in order to re-use it for different types of applications. Particularly, we are focusing on two applications in order to demonstrate the usability of the proposed approach. The first application is the WikiGloss tool, which is based on a glossing approach to help learners of English-as-second-language with an extensive reading task. The second application is an Intelligent Hints service for a Task Management Environment which provides explanatory links from relevant Wikipedia articles related to topics of the e-Learning task. This allows re-use of the same problems in different task type modes such as lectures, exercises, and quizzes.

AB This paper presents Virtual-Machines-MIB, a MIB (Management Information Base) directed to virtual machines management through SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol). Virtual-Machines-MIB aims to define a standard interface for virtual machines management, allowing the management of several virtual machines monitors, like Xen, KVM and VMWare, with a common SNMP management tool. Different from previous virtual machines management MIBs, which allows the manager to perform only monitoring operations, Virtual-Machines-MIB allows to perform control operations, like create, delete, restart, turn on, pause and shut down virtual machines. It is also possible to use the proposed solution to change a virtual machine's name, amount of RAM, virtual CPU's and virtual storage drives. Practical results are presented using ordinary SNMP management tools performing KVM and Xen management. To do this, SNMP agents which support Virtual-Machines-MIB were developed and installed on KVM and Xen hosts. These SNMP agents are based on NET-SNMP public domain's agent, that was extended to support Virtual-Machines-MIB using libvirt API.

AB The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) is a multi-agency, international collaboration that aims at developing the software infrastructure needed to facilitate and empower the study of climate change on a global scale. The ESGF's architecture employs a system of geographically distributed peer nodes, which are independently administered yet united by the adoption of common federation protocols and application programming interfaces (APIs). The cornerstones of its interoperability are the peer-to-peer messaging that is continuously exchanged among all nodes in the federation; a shared architecture and API for search and discovery; and a security infrastructure based on industry standards (OpenID, SSL, GSI and SAML). The ESGF software is developed collaboratively across institutional boundaries and made available to the community as open source. It has now been adopted by multiple Earth science projects and allows access to petabytes of geophysical data, including the entire model output used for the next international assessment report on climate change (IPCC-AR5) and a suite of satellite observations (obs4MIPs) and reanalysis data sets (ANA4MIPs).

AB Present day malware shows stealthy and dynamic capability and avails administrative rights to control the victim computers. Malware writers depend on evasion techniques like code obfuscation, packing, compression, encryption or polymorphism to avoid detection by Anti-Virus (AV) scanners as AV primarily use syntactic signature to detect a known malware. Our approach is based on semantic aspect of PE exectable that analyses API Call-grams to detect unknown malicious code. As in--exact source code is analysed, the machine is not infected by the executable. Moreover, static analysis covers all the paths of code which is not possible with dynamic behavioural methods as latter does not gurantee the execution of sample being analysed. Modern malicious samples also detect controlled virtual and emulated environments and stop the functioning. Semantic invariant approach is important as signature of known samples are changed by code obfuscation tools. Static analysis is performed by generating an API Call graph from control flow of an executable, then mining the Call graph as API Call-gram to detect malicious files.

AB Large frameworks and libraries require extensive developer learning resources, such as documentation and mailing lists, to be useful. Maintaining these learning resources is challenging partly because they are not explicitly linked to the frameworks' API, and changes in the API are not reflected in the learning resources. Automatically recovering traceability links between an API and learning resources is notoriously difficult due to the inherent ambiguity of unstructured natural language. Code elements mentioned in documents are rarely fully qualified, so readers need to understand the context in which a code element is mentioned. We propose a technique that identifies code-like terms in documents and links these terms to specific code elements in an API, such as methods. In an evaluation study with four open source systems, we found that our technique had an average recall and precision of 96%.

AB In practice, it is common that a framework and its client programs evolve simultaneously. Thus, developers of client programs may need to migrate their programs to the new release of the framework when the framework evolves. As framework developers can hardly always guarantee backward compatibility during the evolution of a framework, migration of its client program is often time-consuming and error-prone. To facilitate this migration, researchers have proposed two categories of approaches to identification of framework evolution: operation-based approaches and matching-based approaches. To overcome the main limitations of the two categories of approaches, we propose a novel approach named HiMa, which is based on matching each pair of consecutive revisions recorded in the evolution history of the framework and aggregating revision-level rules to obtain framework-evolution rules. We implemented our HiMa approach as an Eclipse plug-in targeting at frameworks written in Java using SVN as the version-control system. We further performed an experimental study on HiMa together with a state-of-art approach named AURA using six tasks based on three subject Java frameworks. Our experimental results demonstrate that HiMa achieves higher precision and higher recall than AURA in most circumstances and is never inferior to AURA in terms of precision and recall in any circumstances, although HiMa is computationally more costly than AURA.

AB Software reuse through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is an integral part of software development. The functionality offered by an API is not always accessed uniformly throughout the lifetime of a client program. We propose Temporal API Usage Pattern Mining to detect API usage patterns in terms of their time of introduction into client programs. We detect concepts as distinct groups of API functionality from the change history of a client program. We locate those concepts in the client change history and detect temporal usage patterns, where a pattern contains a set of concepts that were added into the client program in a specific temporal order. We investigated the properties of temporal API usage patterns through a multiple-case study of three APIs and their use in up to 19 client software projects. Our technique was able to detect a number of valuable patterns in two out of three of the APIs investigated. Further investigation showed some patterns to be relatively consistent between clients, produced by multiple developers, and not trivially derivable from program structure or API documentation.

AB Users prefer using multiple mobile devices interchangeably by switching between the devices. A solution to this requirement is the migration of applications between mobile devices at runtime. In our vision to move the application from a device A to a device B, instead of synchronizing just the application's data, a simple swiping gesture can be used. Afterwards the user is able to use the same application including its current state on device B. To achieve this, we plan to put the running application on the device A into a paused state, take a snapshot afterwards, move the application to the device B by using a middleware on both devices, extract the snapshot on device B and finally resume it on device B from its paused state. The outcome of the research will be a framework and either a kernel module or an API to migrate mobile applications.

AB Modern software systems build on a significant number of external libraries to deliver feature-rich and high-quality software in a cost-efficient and timely manner. As a consequence, these systems contain a considerable amount of third-party code. External libraries thus have a significant impact on maintenance activities in the project. However, most approaches that assess the maintainability of software systems largely neglect this important factor. Hence, risks may remain unidentified, threatening the ability to effectively evolve the system in the future. We propose a structured approach to assess the third-party library usage in software projects and identify potential problems. Industrial experience strongly influences our approach, which we designed in a lightweight way to enable easy adoption in practice. We present an industrial case study showing the applicability of the approach to a real-world software system.

AB In this paper, we propose a method of Web publishing of three-dimensional city models generated from two-dimensional geographical data. In our approach, the city models are assumed to be historical ones. For an example, rows of houses of Kyoto of the Edo era are generated by determining the areas of the houses based on geographical data and by placing and three-dimensional house models correspondingly. We employed Google Earth as the viewer of the city models. The viewer is embedded into a web page which enables users to access the page to overview the city and look into buildings. Some important documents related to the buildings are also embedded. As an alternative use, we apply the method to generation of city models of tsunami-damaged area in Tohoku district, Japan. The model generation is based on the recovery plan and models are generated by taking changes of terrain in the area into account.

AB The number of Malicious files increase every day because of existing open source malware and obfuscation techniques. It means that traditional signature-based techniques are not adequate for detecting new variant of malware. Researchers and anti malware companies recently focus on more advanced protection which needs influential pattern extraction techniques.
   In this paper, a novel method is proposed based on similarities of binaries behaviors. At first, Run-time behavior of the binary files are found and logged in a controlled environment tool which is developed in-house.
   The approach assumes that behavior of each binary can be represented by the values of memory contents in its run-time. That is, values stored in different registers while the malware is running in the controlled environment can be a distinguishing factor to set it apart from those of benign programs. Then, the register values for each Application Programming Interface (API) call are extracted before and after API is invoked. After that, we traced the distribution and changes of registers values throughout the executable file and created a vector for each of the values of EAX, EBX, EDX, EDI, ESI and EBP registers. With comparing the similarity measures between old and unseen malware vectors, we detected 98% of unseen samples and with 2.9% false positive.

AB Modern malware often changes their runtime behaviors in each execution to tolerate against malware analyses and detections. For example, when a malware copies itself on a file system, it can randomly determine its file name for avoiding the detections. Another example is that when a malware tries to connect its command and control server, it randomly chooses a domain name from a hard-coded domain name list to avoid being blocked by a static blacklist of malicious domain names. We assume that such random behaviors are unnecessary for benign software. Therefore the behaviors can be clues to distinguish malware from benign software. In this paper, we propose a novel malware detection method based on investigating the behavioral difference in multiple executions of suspicious software. Our proposed method conducts dynamic analysis on an executable file multiple times in the same sandbox environment so as to obtain plural lists of API call sequence, and then compares the lists to find the difference between the multiple executions. In the experiments with 5,697 malware samples and 819 benign software samples, the proposed method could detect about 67% malware samples and the false positive rate is about 1%. Moreover, the proposed method could detect 117 malware samples out of 273 malware samples which could not be detected by the antivirus software. Therefore we confirmed the possibility the proposed method may be able to improve the accuracy of malware detection utilizing in combination with other existing methods.

TI Interconnection between IP Networks and Wireless Sensor Networks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB With applications ranging from environmental and health monitoring to military surveillance and inventory tracking, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are changing the way we collect and use data and will be a major part of our technological future. The decreased manufacturing cost of these small devices has made it reasonable to deploy many sensor nodes-tens to thousands and more-over large and small indoor and outdoor areas for sensing tasks. With this increase in density data-gathering problems come. It would be useful if an IP-based host could collect information from multiple remote data-centric networks via transparent communication among sensor nodes and IP-based hosts, using a common application programming interface (API). Two APIs are presented for efficiently producing data in WSN and retrieving the data from an IP network. An associated WSN middleware layer called dynamic service is used to effectively interconnect these two APIs. These three components work together in harmony to enable IP-based hosts to gather sensed data from one or more remote WSNs through application-layer gateways which provide seamless interconnection between different remote WSNs and the IP network.

AB As PLCs evolve from simple logic controllers into more capable Programmable Automation Controllers (PACs), observatories are increasingly using such devices to control complex mechanisms(1,2). This paper describes use of COTS software to control such hardware using the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) Common Services Framework (CSF). We present the Enclosure Control System (ECS) under development in Spain and the UK.
   The paper details selection of the commercial PLC communication library PLCIO. Implemented in C and delivered with source code, the library separates the programmer from communication details through a simple API. Capable of communicating with many types of PLCs (including Allen-Bradley and Siemens) the API remains the same irrespective of PLC in use.
   The ECS is implemented in Java using the observatory's framework that provides common services for software components. We present a design following a connection-based approach where all components access the PLC through a single connection class. The link between Java and PLCIO C library is provided by a thin Java Native Interface (JNI) layer. Also presented is a software simulator of the PLC based upon the PLCIO Virtual PLC. This creates a simulator operating below the library's API and thus requires no change to ECS software. It also provides enhanced software testing capabilities prior to hardware becoming available.
   Results are presented in the form of communication timing test data, showing that the use of CSF, JNI and PLCIO provide a control system capable of controlling enclosure tracking mechanisms, that would be equally valid for telescope mount control.

In this paper we present a proof of concept of compromising an Android based smartphone by targeting the underlying Linux kernel.
   We adopt an unorthodox bottom-up approach on modifying the operating system to allow an application to re-route the Android debug bridge (ADB) daemon onto a wireless link. We support our research using case scenarios to show how information can be extracted and inserted into the smartphone without the knowledge of the user. We discuss how the Android build environment can be changed to harness functionality from secured operations. We also discuss how an application can be designed to function with minimum resources, be hidden and perform operations without user consent or interaction. We also provide an overview of how a rooted Android operating system can be misused.

AB Persistent memory modules with performance similar to that of standard DRAM are becoming commercially available. In addition to the potential decrease in cost and/or capacity, the nonvolatility of data stored in them is opening new doors to improved performance and new capabilities in a wide range of applications. In this paper we address issues involved in providing the software support for effective use of such memory systems. In particular, we discuss the API to be used for accessing persistent memory and propose a novel scheme to provide atomic and in order memory access. Insuring that memory access are performed in order and if need be atomically has turned out to be a significant challenge in the presence of one or more levels of volatile caches. The solutions offered to this date either require disabling caching, significant changes in the hardware, or frequent use of cache flushes and memory fences. All these requirements have a significant impact on the system performance. In contrast, Eucalyptus presented in paper is a software only solution which relaxes these requirements by separating consistency and persistency of data. Preliminary results obtained from our prototype are presented as well.

AB Graphics processing units (GPUs) have been widely used as accelerators in large-scale heterogeneous computing systems. However, current programming models can only support the utilization of local GPUs. When using non-local GPUs, programmers need to explicitly call API functions for data communication across computing nodes. As such, programming GPUs in large-scale computing systems is more challenging than local GPUs since local and remote GPUs have to be dealt with separately. In this work, we propose a virtual OpenCL (VOCL) framework to support the transparent virtualization of GPUs. This framework, based on the OpenCL programming model, exposes physical GPUs as decoupled virtual resources that can be transparently managed independent of the application execution. To reduce the virtualization overhead, we optimize the GPU memory accesses and kernel launches. We also extend the VOCL framework to support live task migration across physical GPUs to achieve load balance and/or quick system maintenance. Our experiment results indicate that VOCL can greatly simplify the task of programming cluster-based GPUs at a reasonable virtualization cost.

AB Reuse of third-party libraries promises significant productivity improvements in software development. However, dependencies on external libraries and their APIs also introduce risks to a project and impact strategic decisions during development and maintenance. Informed decision making therefore requires a thorough understanding of the extent and nature of dependencies on external APIs. As realistically sized applications are often heavily entangled with various external APIs, gaining this understanding is infeasible with manual inspections only. To address this, we present an automated approach to analyze the dependencies of software projects on external APIs. The approach is supported by a static analysis tool featuring a visualization of the analysis results. We evaluate the approach as well as the tooling on multiple open source Java systems.

AB Service resilience, defined as the continued availability of a service despite failures and other negative changes in its environment, is vital in many systems. It is typically achieved by state machine replication using group communication middleware for coordination of service replicas. In this paper we focus on systems that represent critical data as Web resources identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). The best examples of such systems are RESTful web services. We present RESTGroups: a group communication front-end for RESTful web services. Our system is based on Spread - a popular group communication toolkit. Contrary to Spread and other such toolkits, we represent group communication services as resources on the Web, addressed by URIs. In the paper, we describe the system architecture and the API.

TI Engineering use cases for modular development of ontologies in OWL
SO APPLIED ONTOLOGY
AB This paper presents use cases for modular development of ontologies using the OWL imports mechanism. Many of the methods are inspired by work in modular development in software engineering. The approach is aimed at developers of large ontologies covering multiple subdomains that make use of OWL reasoners for inference. Such ontologies are common in biomedical sciences, but nothing in the paper is specific to biomedicine. There are four groups of use cases: (i) organisation and factoring of ontologies; (ii) maintaining stable interfaces and bindings between ontologies and between ontologies and software; (iii) localization of ontologies to the requirements of specific sites and (iv) extension of ontologies and encapsulation of modifications. OWL's axiom-oriented import mechanism has many similarities with import mechanisms in object-oriented software but also important differences in particular, the effects of OWL imports are global, and the order in which modules are imported is irrelevant. The advantages and disadvantages of OWL's axiom-oriented approach are discussed, and suggestions are made for extensions to allow axioms to be filtered out as well as added - a mechanism that we term "adaptation" to distinguish it from the standard import mechanism. Finally we discuss possible alternatives and practical experience with the approaches presented.

AB Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is one of the newly developed intelligence optimization algorithms. With its simple concept, few parameters and scalable performance, PSO has become a very promising optimization tool and attracted extensive attention. In this paper, probabilistic analysis on swarm diversity in Adaptive Partly Informed Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (API-PSO) was conducted. From the analysis results we can learn that the expectation of population diversity in the next moment are affected by the population size, problem-solving dimensions, the topology and the specific optimization function to be solved, ect. We also get the relationship between the current population diversity and the state of next time. This information could serve as the theoretic basis to solve swarm diversity lack, facilitate swarm evolution development and improve algorithm performance.

TI Variable high-gain disturbance observer design with online adaption of
   observer gains embedded in numerical integration
SO MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION
AB In this paper, a variable gain design approach for the high-gain disturbance observer, called Proportional-Integral-Observer (PI-Observer), is proposed to solve the problem of choosing suitable observer gains. The high-gain PI-Observer is successfully applied to estimate unknown inputs of systems together with the system states. Ills known that reasonable estimations of unknown inputs can only be derived using high observer gains. On the other hand, extremely large gains will cause serious problems with respect to measurements noise and unmodeled dynamics. According to the analysis of the estimation quality regarding to the factors which influence the estimation results, the optimal level of observer gains is changing during the estimation, an online adaption for the observer gains is therefore developed. The designed PI-Observer, called Advanced PI-Observer (API-Observer), will use changing observer gains from the adaption algorithm, which is proved to give stable estimation error dynamics. Simulation results from an elastic beam example are shown to illustrate the implementation of the API-Observer. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Performance analysis of multi-level parallelism: inter-node, intra-node
   and hardware accelerators
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB The advent of multi-core processors has made parallel computing techniques mandatory on mainstream systems. With the recent rise in hardware accelerators, hybrid parallelism adds yet another dimension of complexity to the process of software development. The inner workings of a parallel program are usually difficult to understand and verify. This paper presents a tool for graphical program flow analysis of hardware accelerated parallel programs. It monitors the hybrid program execution to record and visualize many performance relevant events along the way. Representative real-world applications written for both IBM's Cell processor and NVIDIA's CUDA API are studied exemplarily. With our combined monitoring and visualization approach for hardware accelerated multi-core and multi-node systems we take the next step in tool evolution towards a highly improved level of detail, precision, and completeness. The contents of this paper is of interest to developers of hardware accelerated applications as well as performance tool architects. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The emergence of web services gives rise to service ecosystems, where core service platforms are exposed through APIs to a large number of third parties to provide new solutions. This often requires platform APIs to be able to evolve rapidly while not breaking backward compatibility in order to support a wider range of planned and unplanned use. The REST architecture style allows a service contract to be negotiated and delivered at runtime aiming to achieve higher level of evolvability. However this potential is often not fully realized due to the lack of systematic approach in architecture design to separate requirement-related contract elements from specification-related elements and integrate them into the overall API design. In this paper, we present a novel approach to designing service platform APIs in order to achieve high evolvability. We firstly apply the problem frames approach to better understand the interface coupling and the evolution of requirements. Based on the problem frame analysis, we propose a media-type centric approach to designing RESTful service API. We applied our approach to the Twitter API evolution. The result shows significant improvements in the areas of contract leaking prevention, interface consistency and adding new features.

AB Backward compatibility is a major concern for any library developer. In this paper, we evaluate how stable a set of frequently used third-party libraries is in terms of method removals, implementation change, the ratio of change in old methods to change in new ones and the percentage of new methods in each snapshot. We provide a motivating example of a commercial company which demonstrates several issues associated with the usage of third-party libraries. To obtain dependencies from software systems we developed a framework which extracts dependencies from Maven build files and which analyzes system and library code. We propose four metrics which provide different insights in the implementation and interface stability of a library. The usage frequency of library methods is utilized as a weight in the final metric and is obtained from a dataset of more than 2300 snapshots of 140 industrial Java systems. We finally describe three scenarios and an example of the application of our metrics.

AB Accessibility is unfortunately not among the main concern when developing web sites. Webmasters create mostly involuntarily numerous obstacles for people with visual impairments. That's why it becomes fundamental to identify the existing barriers and to propose solutions in order to at least diminish their impact to the user. Accessibility guidelines, as WCAG 2.0, indicate that a minimum difference of brightness, tonality and contrast is necessary to reach a minimum level of accessibility. In numerous cases, web designers ignore or just limit their choices to a low level of accessibility. For an user needing a higher level of accessibility than the one offered by the web page, the access to information may be difficult. In this context, we propose to transform the colors of web pages according to user's needs with the help of a clientside HTTP proxy. The requirements for the colors can be expressed as a fitness function. In order to recolor the page to increase accessibility, it's enough to minimize the fitness function.
   Trying to find a minimum can be a time consuming task not appropriate for real time recoloring. Finding a minimum can be considered as a search with varying time limits. In this article, our objective is to compare different search methods and their performance under time limit: the search can be interrupted at any time. The studied methods are a random search, different types of pseudo gradient descend and an adaptation of the API metaheuristic. Finally, the different methods are compared.

AB The use of GPU for general-purpose computing is a relatively new and promising direction. The use of GPUs as vector accelerators becomes more and more popular, but different vendors offer their own API and languages. As a result, transition from one platform to another sometimes requires enormous code changes. The answer to this problem is OpenCL [1]. All major CPU and GPU manufacturers created their own implementations for their devices. OpenCL is the open standard for parallel programming of heterogeneous computations.
   This report discusses questions on organization of computing with OpenCL. First, we will talk about advantages and disadvantages of CPU and GPU computing. Then test results will be shown, we will represent algorithms that have significant speedup using GPGPU computations. At last, some examples of applications and libraries that use OpenCL will be discussed. Special attention is paid to generation of a proper operational environment for such heterogeneous computations. We argue that virtualization is crucial for proper load balancing. All calculations were performed on a hybrid cluster of SPbSU computing center. Its nodes contain a NVIDIA Tesla M2050 system that was developed specifically as a GPGPU unit. Such devices provide substantial speedups for scientific calculations [2].

AB Refactoring is the process of changing the design of a program without changing its behaviour. Many refactoring tools have been developed for various programming languages; however, their support for composite refactorings - refactorings that are composed from a number of primitive refactorings - is limited. In particular, there is a lack of powerful and easy-to-use frameworks that allow users to script their own large-scale refactorings efficiently and effectively.
   This paper introduces the domain-specific language framework of Wrangler - a refactoring and code inspection tool for Erlang programs that allows users to script composite refactorings, test them and apply them on the fly. The composite refactorings are fully integrated into Wrangler and so can be previewed, applied and 'undone' interactively.

AB Nowadays, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) are so regarded in order to improve education quality via new technologies in this area. One of the problems is that the language of ITSs is different from the learner's. It forces the learners to learn the system language. This paper tries to remove this necessity by using an Automatic Translator Component in system structure like Google Translate API. This system carry out a pre-test and post-test by using Expert System and Jackson Model before and after of training a concept. It constantly updates learner model to save all changes in learning process. So this paper offers an E-Learning system which is web-based, intelligent, adaptive, multilingual and remotely accessible where tutors and learners can have non-identical language. It is also applicable Every Time and Every Where (ETEW). Furthermore, it trains the concepts in the best method with any language and low cost.

AB Malware landscape has been dramatically elevated over the last decade. The main reason of the increase is that new malware variants can be produced easily using simple code obfuscation techniques. Once the obfuscation is applied, the malware can change their syntactics while preserving semantics, and bypass anti-virus (AV) scanners. Malware authors, thus, commonly use the code obfuscation techniques to generate metamorphic malware. Nevertheless, signature based AV techniques are limited to detect the metamorphic malware since they are commonly based on the syntactic signature matching. In this paper, we propose BinGraph, a new mechanism that accurately discovers metamorphic malware. BinGraph leverages the semantics of malware, since the mutant malware is able to manipulate their syntax only. To this end, we first extract API calls from malware and convert to a hierarchical behavior graph that represents with identical 128 nodes based on the semantics. Later, we extract unique subgraphs from the hierarchical behavior graphs as semantic signatures representing common behaviors of a specific malware family. To evaluate BinGraph, we analyzed a total of 827 malware samples that consist of 10 malware families with 1,202 benign binaries. Among the malware, 20% samples randomly chosen from each malware family were used for extracting semantic signatures, and rest of them were used for assessing detection accuracy. Finally, only 32 subgraphs were selected as the semantic signatures. BinGraph discovered malware variants with 98% of detection accuracy.

AB Cloud computing has taken center stage in the present business scenario due to its pay-as-you-use nature, where users need not bother about buying resources like hardware, software, infrastructure, etc. permanently. As much as the technological benefits, cloud computing also has risks involved. By looking at its financial benefits, customers who cannot afford initial investments, choose cloud by compromising on the security concerns. At the same time due to its risks, customers relatively majority in number, avoid migration towards cloud. This paper analyzes the current security challenges in cloud computing environment based on state-of-the-art cloud computing security taxonomies under technological and process-related aspects.

TI Injecting Semantic Annotations into (Geospatial) Web service
   descriptions
SO SEMANTIC WEB
AB Geospatial Web services comply with well-established standards to support seamless integration into applications ranging from commercial Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to open source web mapping clients. Descriptions of service capabilities contain information about the provided data. Updates to the underlying database result in changing descriptions. To ensure compatibility with existing solutions, semantic enablement of Geospatial Web services has to reflect both, standards and changing metadata. Semantic annotations link between legacy non-semantic Web service descriptions and their semantic counterparts. The open source Semantic Annotations Proxy (SAPR) is a light-weight RESTful API deployed as free service which "injects" semantic annotations into existing Web service descriptions without breaking the standards. This approach decouples the annotations from the original metadata, which ensures the separation of concerns between data providers and end users with different and sometimes conflicting views on annotations. In addition, the service is robust regarding changes of the service descriptions. The presented approach is focusing on W3C-and OGC-compliant Web services, but can be theoretically applied on any kind of information source with structured metadata.

TI Recommending Adaptive Changes for Framework Evolution
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY
AB In the course of a framework's evolution, changes ranging from a simple refactoring to a complete rearchitecture can break client programs. Finding suitable replacements for framework elements that were accessed by a client program and deleted as part of the framework's evolution can be a challenging task. We present a recommendation system, SemDiff, that suggests adaptations to client programs by analyzing how a framework was adapted to its own changes. In a study of the evolution of one open source framework and three client programs, our approach recommended relevant adaptive changes with a high level of precision. In a second study of the evolution of two frameworks, we found that related change detection approaches were better at discovering systematic changes and that SemDiff was complementary to these approaches by detecting non-trivial changes such as when a functionality is imported from an external library.

TI Benchmarking library and application software with Data Envelopment
   Analysis
SO SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL
AB Library software is generally believed to be well-structured and follows certain design guidelines due to the need of continuous evolution and stability of the respective APIs. We perform an empirical study to investigate whether the design of open-source library software is actually superior to that of application software. By analyzing certain design principles and heuristics that are considered important for API design, we extract a set of software metrics that are expected to reflect the improved nature of libraries. An initial comparison by conventional statistical analysis confirms the overall belief that products of different software size scale should not be compared by simply examining metric values in isolation. In this paper, we propose the use of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), borrowed from production economics, as a means of measuring and benchmarking the quality of different object-oriented software designs captured by software metrics and apply this approach to the comparison of library and application software. The advantages offered by DEA and the differences between the application of DEA in an economic and a technological context are discussed. Results of the approach are presented for 44 open-source projects, equally divided between libraries and applications.

AB In writing parallel programs, programmers expose parallelism and optimize it to meet a particular performance goal on a single platform under an assumed set of workload characteristics. In the field, changing workload characteristics, new parallel platforms, and deployments with different performance goals make the programmer's development-time choices suboptimal. To address this problem, this paper presents the Degree of Parallelism Executive (DoPE), an API and run-time system that separates the concern of exposing parallelism from that of optimizing it. Using the DoPE API, the application developer expresses parallelism options. During program execution, DoPE's run-time system uses this information to dynamically optimize the parallelism options in response to the facts on the ground. We easily port several emerging parallel applications to DoPE's API and demonstrate the DoPE run-time system's effectiveness in dynamically optimizing the parallelism for a variety of performance goals.

AB Programming language design benefits from constructs for extending the syntax and semantics of a host language. While C's string-based macros empower programmers to introduce notational shorthands, the parser-level macros of Lisp encourage experimentation with domain-specific languages. The Scheme programming language improves on Lisp with macros that respect lexical scope.
   The design of Racket-a descendant of Scheme-goes even further with the introduction of a full-fledged interface to the static semantics of the language. A Racket extension programmer can thus add constructs that are indistinguishable from "native" notation, large and complex embedded domain-specific languages, and even optimizing transformations for the compiler backend. This power to experiment with language design has been used to create a series of sub-languages for programming with first-class classes and modules, numerous languages for implementing the Racket system, and the creation of a complete and fully integrated typed sister language to Racket's untyped base language.
   This paper explains Racket's language extension API via an implementation of a small typed sister language. The new language provides a rich type system that accommodates the idioms of untyped Racket. Furthermore, modules in this typed language can safely exchange values with untyped modules. Last but not least, the implementation includes a type-based optimizer that achieves promising speedups. Although these extensions are complex, their Racket implementation is just a library, like any other library, requiring no changes to the Racket implementation.

TI In from the Edge: The Progressive Evolution of Publishing in the Age of
   Digital Abundance
SO PUBLISHING RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB The forces for change in the 600 hundred-year history of book publishing have never been more powerful and fundamental than in 2011. Barely 12 months ago, what publishers viewed as "innovation" was the creation of digitized versions of physical books to be 'consumed' on e-reading devices. As 2011 begins, that change is largely regarded as accepted business practice, and the edge of "innovation" is moving in more complex directions. Publishing finds itself in the midst of a 'phase shift' from the scarcity model of print to a complex, new world of digital abundance. The dimensions of change, moreover, its speed, and its extent are still unknown. While book publishing begins with the creative work of authors, digital technologies are turning the business models inside out. Among the forces for change acting on book publishing, this article examines several phenomena that are working their way in from the edge to the center of the industry, including complex interwoven considerations around container, context, and customer.

TI MACs: Mining API code snippets for code reuse
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB We apply data mining to source code projects to guide developers through related API usage patterns: "Developers who code the program statement also code..." Given a set of source code files, the mined association rules suggest related code snippets to form the components of object-oriented programs. The mined sequential rules predict likely additional API sequences within a method. After an initial program statement is given, our MACs prototype can correctly predict useful related API code snippets. In our evaluation, we present two studies investigating the usefulness of MACs in software development tasks. One study evaluated the utility of MACs's association pattern recommendations. The other evaluated usefulness of sequential pattern recommendations, and both drew from a sample of eight source code projects from SourceForge.net. Our experimental evaluation shows that MACs has significant potential to assist developers, especially API newcomers, and provides an alternative method for code reuse. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Targeting Complex Embedded Architectures by Combining the Multicore
   Communications API (MCAPI) with Compile-Time Virtualisation
SO ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES
AB Within the domain of embedded systems, hardware architectures are commonly characterised by application-specific heterogeneity. Systems may contain multiple dissimilar processing elements, nonstandard memory architectures, and custom hardware elements. The programming of such systems is a considerable challenge, not only because of the need to exploit large degrees of parallelism but also because hardware architectures change from system to system. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the novel combination of a new industry standard for communication across multicore architectures (MCAPI), with a minimal-overhead technique for targeting complex architectures with standard programming languages (Compile-Time Virtualisation).
   The Multicore Association have proposed MCAPI as an industry standard for on-chip communications. MCAPI abstracts the on-chip physical communication to provide the application with logical point-to-point unidirectional channels between nodes (software thread, hardware core, etc.). Compile-Time Virtualisation is used to provide an extremely lightweight implementation of MCAPI, that supports a much wider range of architectures than its specification normally considers. Overall, this unique combination enhances programmability by abstracting on-chip communication whilst also exposing critical parts of the target architecture to the programming language.

TI Malware detection using assembly and API call sequences
SO JOURNAL IN COMPUTER VIROLOGY AND HACKING TECHNIQUES
AB One of the major problems concerning information assurance is malicious code. To evade detection, malware has also been encrypted or obfuscated to produce variants that continue to plague properly defended and patched networks with zero day exploits. With malware and malware authors using obfuscation techniques to generate automated polymorphic and metamorphic versions, antivirus software must always keep up with their samples and create a signature that can recognize the new variants. Creating a signature for each variant in a timely fashion is a problem that anti-virus companies face all the time. In this paper we present detection algorithms that can help the antivirus community to ensure a variant of a known malware can still be detected without the need of creating a signature; a similarity analysis (based on specific quantitative measures) is performed to produce a matrix of similarity scores that can be utilized to determine the likelihood that a piece of code under inspection contains a particular malware. Two general malware detection methods presented in this paper are: Static Analyzer for Vicious Executables (SAVE) and Malware Examiner using Disassembled Code (MEDiC). MEDiC uses assembly calls for analysis and SAVE uses API calls (Static API call sequence and Static API call set) for analysis. We show where Assembly can be superior to API calls in that it allows a more detailed comparison of executables. API calls, on the other hand, can be superior to Assembly for its speed and its smaller signature. Our two proposed techniques are implemented in SAVE) and MEDiC. We present experimental results that indicate that both of our proposed techniques can provide a better detection performance against obfuscated malware. We also found a few false positives, such as those programs that use network functions (e.g. PuTTY) and encrypted programs (no API calls or assembly functions are found in the source code) when the thresholds are set 50% similarity measure. However, these false positives can be minimized, for example by changing the threshold value to 70% that determines whether a program falls in the malicious category or not.

TI Robust authentication and key agreement scheme preserving the privacy of
   secret key
SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
AB In ubiquitous computing environments, people may obtain their services from application servers by using mobile devices at any time and anywhere. For convenience, most of those devices are small and of limited power and computation capacity. In this paper, we propose a robust user authentication and key agreement scheme suitable for ubiquitous computing environments. The main merits include: (1) a security-sensitive verification table is not required in the server; (2) the password can be chosen and changed freely by the clients and cannot be derived by the privileged administrator of the server; (3) all well-known security threats are solved in our proposed scheme; (4) the scheme does not have a serious time-synchronization problem; (5) the client and the server can establish a common session key; (6) the scheme is practical and efficient; (7) the scheme can preserve the privacy of the client's secret key even if the secret information stored in a smart card is compromised.

AB The AGROVOC multilingual thesaurus maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is now published as linked data. In order to reach this goal AGROVOC was expressed in Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), and its concepts provided with dereferenceable URIs. AGROVOC is now aligned with ten other multilingual knowledge organization systems related to agriculture, using the SKOS properties exact match and close match. Alignments were automatically produced in Eclipse using a custom-designed tool and then validated by a domain expert. The resulting data is publicly available to both humans and machines using a SPARQL endpoint together with a modified version of Pubby, a lightweight front-end tool for publishing linked data. This paper describes the process that led to the current linked data AGROVOC and discusses current and future applications and directions.

CL Changsha, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB We present the design, implementation, and an evaluation of Elastic Phoenix. Based on the original Phoenix from Stanford, Elastic Phoenix is also a Map Reduce implementation for shared-memory systems. The key new feature of Elastic Phoenix is that it supports malleable jobs: the ability add and remove worker processes during the execution of a job. With the original Phoenix, the number of processors to be used is fixed at start-up time. With Elastic Phoenix, if more resources become available (as they might on an elastic cloud computing system), they can be dynamically added to an existing job. If resources are reclaimed, they can also be removed from an existing job. The concept of malleable jobs is well known in job scheduling research, but an implementation of a malleable programming system like Elastic Phoenix is less common.
   We show how dynamically increasing the resources available to an Elastic Phoenix workload as it runs can reduce response time by 29% compared to a statically resourced workload. We detail the changes to the Phoenix application programming interface (API) made to support the new capability, and discuss the implementation changes to the Phoenix code base. We show that any additional run-time overheads introduced by Elastic Phoenix can be offset by the benefits of dynamically adding processor resources.

AB Ensuring the freshness of client data is a fundamental problem for applications that rely on cloud infrastructure to store data and mediate sharing. Thialfi is a notification service developed at Google to simplify this task. Thialfi supports applications written in multiple programming languages and running on multiple platforms, e.g., browsers, phones, and desktops. Applications register their interest in a set of shared objects and receive notifications when those objects change. Thialfi servers run in multiple Google data centers for availability and replicate their state asynchronously. Thialfi's approach to recovery emphasizes simplicity: all server state is soft, and clients drive recovery and assist in replication. A principal goal of our design is to provide a straightforward API and good semantics despite a variety of failures, including server crashes, communication failures, storage unavailability, and data center failures.
   Evaluation of live deployments confirms that Thialfi is scalable, efficient, and robust. In production use, Thialfi has scaled to millions of users and delivers notifications with an average delay of less than one second.

AB Embedded, textual DSLs are often provided as an API wrapped around object-oriented application frameworks to ease framework integration. While literature presents claims that DSL-based application development is beneficial, empirical evidence for this is rare. We present the results of an experiment comparing the complexity of three different object-oriented framework APIs and an embedded, textual DSL. For this comparative experiment, we implemented the same, non-trivial application scenario using these four different APIs. Then, we performed an Object-Points (OP) analysis, yielding indicators for the API complexity specific to each API variant. The main observation for our experiment is that the embedded, textual DSL incurs the smallest API complexity. Although the results are exploratory, as well as limited to the given application scenario and a single embedded DSL, our findings can direct future empirical work. The experiment design is applicable for similar API design evaluations.

This specification follows the publisher/subscriber paradigm and it is characterized by providing an API that allows tuning the QoS (Quality of Service) of the applications with a large set of parameters. This paper proposes using DDS as the backbone for industrial communications at the control level. In particular, we advocate Its use to combine sending critical information such as alarms and real-time periodic information with less critical information related to configuration, diagnostic or maintenance operations.

Our techniques include: use of ghost state to attach formal algebraic terms to concrete byte arrays and to detect collisions when two distinct terms map to the same byte array; decoration of a crypto API with contracts based on symbolic terms; and expression of the attacker model in terms of C programs. We rely on the general-purpose verifier VCC; we guide VCC to prove security simply by writing suitable header files and annotations in implementation files, rather than by changing VCC itself. We formalize the symbolic model in Coq in order to justify the addition of axioms to VCC.

AB Following ten years of experience using the Scalable Simulation Framework (SSF), we revisited its API, making changes to better reflect use and support maintainability. This paper gives a quick overview of SSF, and discusses changes made in the second-generation API, S3F. Of particular interest is S3F's treatment of advancing time (in epochs), its treatment of "processes", and the support it gives the modeler over precise ordering of events that happen to be scheduled at the same simulation time.

TI An Empirical Investigation into the Role of API-Level Refactorings

AB It is widely believed that refactoring improves software quality and programmer productivity by making it easier to maintain and understand software systems. However, the role of refactorings has not been systematically investigated using fine-grained evolution history. We quantitatively and qualitatively studied API-level refactorings and bug fixes in three large open source projects, totaling 26523 revisions of evolution.
   The study found several surprising results: One, there is an increase in the number of bug fixes after API-level refactorings. Two, the time taken to fix bugs is shorter after API-level refactorings than before. Three, a large number of refactoring revisions include bug fixes at the same time or are related to later bug fix revisions. Four, API-level refactorings occur more frequently before than after major software releases. These results call for re-thinking refactoring's true benefits. Furthermore, frequent floss refactoring mistakes observed in this study call for new software engineering tools to support safe application of refactoring and behavior modifying edits together.

AB When the Application Programming Interface (API) of a framework or library changes, its clients must be adapted. This change propagation-known as a ripple effect-is a problem that has garnered interest: several approaches have been proposed in the literature to react to these changes.
   Although studies of ripple effects exist at the single system level, no study has been performed on the actual extent and impact of these API changes in practice, on an entire software ecosystem associated with a community of developers. This paper reports on early results of such an empirical study of API changes that led to ripple effects across an entire ecosystem. Our case study subject is the development community gravitating aroung the Squeak and Pharo software ecosystems: six years of evolution, nearly 3,000 contributors, and close to 2,500 distinct systems.

AB Software systems often undergo significant changes in their life cycle, exposing increasingly complex API to their developers. Without methodical guidances, it is easy to become bogged down in a morass of complex API even for the professional software developers. This paper presents the Flow-Augmented Call Graph (FACG) for taming API complexity. Augmenting the call graph with control flow analysis brings us a new insight to capture the significance of the caller-callee linkages in the call graph. We apply the proposed FACG in API recommendation and compare our approach with the state-of-the-art approaches in the same domain. The evaluation result indicates that our approach is more effective in retrieving the relevant APIs with regard to the original API documentation.

AB With the evolution of an API library, its documentation also evolves. The evolution of API documentation is common knowledge for programmers and library developers, but not in a quantitative form. Without such quantitative knowledge, programmers may neglect important revisions of API documentation, and library developers may not effectively improve API documentation based on its revision histories. There is a strong need to conduct a quantitative study on API documentation evolution. However, as API documentation is large in size and revisions can be complicated, it is quite challenging to conduct such a study. In this paper, we present an analysis methodology to analyze the evolution of API documentation. Based on the methodology, we conduct a quantitative study on API documentation evolution of five widely used real-world libraries. The results reveal various valuable findings, and these findings allow programmers and library developers to better understand API documentation evolution.

AB Efficient data manipulation API is a necessary prerequisite in satisfying a number of acute needs of ERP system developers and eventually end-users. The current work defines the efficiency as an ability of accessing and manipulating ERP data at any granularity level, while maintaining integrity of the data. This paper contributes with the concept of query-like service invocation implemented in the form of a business object query language (BOQL). Essentially, BOQL provides on-the-fly orchestration of CRUD-operations of business objects in an ERP system and allows to achieve both the flexibility of SQL and encapsulation of SOA. A special design effort has been dedicated to making BOQL scalable and resistant to changes in data schema of the system. To demonstrate the power of the suggested concept navigation, configuration and composite application development scenarios are presented in the paper. All suggestions have been prototyped with Microsoft .Net platform.

AB Process migrating technology usually is used to solve the problems like user process death, system crash or lower executing efficiency because of the load unbalancing among the multi-processors. Virtual machine can supply system level backup and migration. But it is too much overhead sometimes. In this paper, a process migration technology on program level is put forward and a demo program has been developed for validation. It possesses high performance, low cost and pertinence. Aiming at the information involved in process migration, obtain process data from JVM by calling Java JDI API, and transmit them to the node having idle computing resources. This technology is platform-independent, and the efficiency of distributed system would be enhanced with it. It also has the advantages such as strong commonality, protecting local environment from intrusion, and preventing from malicious code filching local information.

AB Typically data collection, transcription, language model generation, and deployment are separate phases of creating a spoken language interface. An unfortunate consequence of this is that the recognizer usually remains a static element of systems often deployed in dynamic environments. By providing an API for human intelligence, Amazon Mechanical Turk changes the way system developers can construct spoken language systems. In this work, we describe an architecture that automates and connects these four phases, effectively allowing the developer to grow a spoken language interface. In particular, we show that a human-in-the-loop programming paradigm, in which workers transcribe utterances behind the scenes, can alleviate the need for expert guidance in language model construction. We demonstrate the utility of these organic language models in a voice-search interface for photographs.

AB This paper systematically evaluates four different APIs provided by popular ERP systems (SAP BAPI, SAP eSOA, Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Intuit Quickbooks) according to their potential for service-oriented enterprise application integration. Central is here the quality of access to and control of their business objects for developing complex business processes in a service oriented landscape. In an ideal world this development should be directly in the hands of the application/business experts, and thus be possible without coding. This can only work if the technical APIs can (semi-) automatically be bridged to a level an application expert can master, which leads to additional API requirements. Our evaluation reveals that the currently still quite unsatisfactory quality of the APIs very much reflects the business profile of each ERP solution. We are therefore convinced that, with changing market conditions, future ERP solutions will live up to the identified requirements.

AB In the field of professional pilot training, flight simulator is becoming increasingly important, which draws more and more attention from people nowadays. For effectively guiding and assessing the training quality of pilots while being trained, the system needed to record the video of the flight data from monitors without bringing any changes to the flight simulator. After that the system extracted the frames from the video and the images would be processed through binarization. So we could easily recognize the flight data from the binarization images by using the pattern recognition technology. Thus the flight track could be reconstructed in three dimension based on the OpenGL API, which will be very beneficial to the training. Altogether, the system can take advantage of the resources to guide and assess the training process of pilots more efficiently as well as developing the pilot training industry.

AB Smart Grid initiatives aim to overlay the existing power grid infrastructure with a communication and computation infrastructure to enable integration of renewable resources and increased efficiency and reliability of the electric power grid. This requires substantial changes to the existing centralized control architecture as well as the development of drastically more powerful communication and computation infrastructure. In this paper, we describe the elements required for implementation of a "Prosumer" based distributed control architecture for smart grid. We illustrate the operation of this distributed control architecture through the case study of a Demand Response application. We propose a Hard Real Time enabled, Web Services based computing infrastructure that can support the development as well as the operation of this distributed control architecture. Main components of this computing infrastructure are a Generic Real Time API (Generic RT-API) for platform independence, a Rule based Configurable API Translator, a Hard Real Time Web Services (HRT-WS) Engine and the ability to receive XML based configuration/control instructions remotely. We describe the status of our prototype implementation for this computing infrastructure using LXRT/RTAI based Hard Real Time Linux environment.

AB Today's software development depends greatly on frameworks and libraries. When their APIs evolve, developers must update their programs accordingly. Existing approaches facilitate the upgrading process by generating change-rules based on various input data, such call dependency, text similarity, software metrics, etc. However, existing approaches do not provide 100% precision and recall because of the limited set of input data that they use to generate change-rules. For example, an approach only considering text similarity usually discovers less change-rules then that considering both text similarity and call dependency with similar precision. But adding more input data may increase the complexity of the change-rule generating algorithms and make them unpractical. We propse MOFAE (Multi-Objective Framework API Evolution) by modeling framework API evolution as multi-objective optimization problem to take more input data into account while generating change-rules and to control the algorithmic complexity.

AB Whereas software adaptation has been identified as an effective approach for addressing context-aware applications, the existing work on WSNs fails to support context-awareness and mostly focuses on developing techniques to reprogram the whole sensor node rather than reconfiguring a particular portion of the sensor application software. Therefore, enabling adaptively in the higher layers of the network architecture such as the middleware and application layers, beside the consideration in the lower layers, becomes of high importance. In this paper we propose an approach to hide heterogeneity and offer a single common configuration and processing component for all nodes of that heterogeneous system. This advances the current state-of-the-art, by providing a lego-like model whereby a single simple but powerful component is deployed in any node regardless of its underlying differences and the system is able to remotely configure and process data in any node in a most flexible way, since every node has the same uniform API, processing and access functionalities.

AB The trend in the design of complex instruments is toward distributed control systems implemented with networks of embedded devices. Historically these embedded networks have been implemented using field busses such as CAN, LonWorks, or ProfiNet but the ubiquitous nature and low cost of Ethernet has made it the trend in embedded network applications. Ethernet, however, largely depends on DHCP and DNS servers or static IP addressing scheme to enable communication between devices on the network. This paper presents a service-oriented architecture for self-configuring Ethernet-based distributed control systems that is able to adapt to changes in network topology without manual intervention. The three core technologies used to enable self-configuration are all part of Zero Configuration Networking: link-local address auto-configuration for automatic IP address assignment, multicast DNS for automatic hostname resolution, and multicast DNS service discovery for automatic discovery of services. A temperature control system is developed as a case study implementation of the architecture using Java and SOAP web services. Programming web services is simplified using the Java API for XML-Web Services. Programmer productivity is also improved since Java enables the use of enterprise level development tools for debugging and deployment.

AB A user task often spans multiple heterogeneous devices, e.g., working on a PC in the office and continuing the work on a laptop or a mobile phone while commuting on a shuttle. However, there is a lack of support for users to easily migrate their tasks across devices. To address this problem, we created Deep Shot, a framework for capturing the user's work state that is needed for a task (e.g., the specific part of a webpage being viewed) and resuming it on a different device. In particular, Deep Shot supports two novel and intuitive interaction techniques, deep shooting and deep posting, for pulling and pushing work states, respectively, using a mobile phone camera. In addition, Deep Shot provides a concise API for developers to leverage its services and make their application states migratable. We demonstrated that Deep Shot can be used to support a range of everyday tasks migrating across devices. An evaluation consisting of a series of experiments showed that our framework and techniques are feasible.

AB The current trend in processor design seems to focus on using multiple cores, similar to a cluster-on-a-chip model. These processors are generally fast and power efficient, but due to their highly parallel nature, they are notoriously difficult to program for most scientists. One such processor is the CELL broadband engine (CELL-BE) which is known for its high performance, but also for a complex programming model which makes it difficult to exploit the architecture to its full potential. To address this difficulty, this paper proposes to change the programming model to use the principles of CSP design, thus making it simpler to program the CELL-BE and avoid livelocks, deadlocks and race conditions. The CSP model described here comprises a thread library for the synergistic processing elements (SPEs) and a simple channel based communication interface. To examine the scalability of the implementation, experiments are performed with both scientific computational cores and synthetic workloads. The implemented CSP model has a simple API and is shown to scale well for problems with significant computational requirements.

AB This paper presents VMFlockMS, a migration service optimized for cross-datacenter transfer and instantiation of groups of virtual machine (VM) images that comprise an application-level solution (e.g., a three-tier web application). We dub these groups of related VM images VMFlocks. VMFlockMS employs two main techniques: first, data deduplication within the VMFlock to be migrated, and among the VMs in the VMFlock and the data already present at the destination datacenter. Second, accelerated instantiation of the application at the target datacenter after transferring only a partial set of data blocks and prioritization of the remaining data based on previously observed access patterns originating from the running VMs. VMFlockMS is designed to be deployed as a set of virtual appliances which make efficient use of the available cloud resources to locally access and deduplicate the images and data in a distributed fashion with minimal requirements imposed on the cloud API to access the VM image repository.
   VMFlockMS provides an incrementally scalable and high-performance migration service. Our evaluation shows that VMFlockMS can reduce the data volumes to be transferred over the network to as low as 3% of the original VMFlock size, enables the complete transfer of the VM images belonging to a VMFlock over transcontinental link up to 3.5x faster than alternative approaches, and enables booting these VM images with as little as 5% of the compressed VMFlock data available at the destination.

AB Intelligent Network is a telephone network architecture in which the service logic for a call is located separately from the switching facilities, allowing services to be added or changed without having to redesign switching equipment. The Java Community, within the Java APIs for Integrated Networks activities, offers a set of standard frameworks and open protocol APIs for the creation of telecommunications services. Currently the only open source implementation of JSLEE specifications is Mobicents. This paper proposes a solution for protocol-agnostic service creation in Mobicents platform. In our proposed solution, services depend on an abstract API defined by specifications from the JAIN group and implemented by a custom JSLEE Resource Adaptor. Discrete-event simulation model was used, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution.

AB The purpose of this paper is to construct a multi-objective optimization model for cooperative pricing in the management of apparel supply chain. Firstly, by using Apparel Popularity Index (API) model, a kind of pricing model for supply chain has been built. Then, by introducing cooperation and other constraint conditions, a kind of cooperative pricing model was constructed. This model is a kind of Stackelberg game. The manufacturer and the retailer obtained their excess profits through the game. Lastly, this paper gave a numerical example which demonstrated that the excess profit of the cooperative supply chain was constant, and when the constraint conditions changed, the excess profit space would change at the meantime. This research result can help partners on apparel supply chain to practice Quick Response strategy.

AB Within the domain of embedded systems, hardware architectures are commonly characterised by application-specific heterogeneity. Systems may contain multiple dissimilar processing elements, nonstandard memory architectures, and custom hardware elements. The programming of such systems is a considerable challenge, not only because of the need to exploit large degrees of parallelism but also because hardware architectures change from system to system. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the novel combination of a new industry standard for communication across multicore architectures (MCAPI), with a minimal-overhead technique for targeting complex architectures with standard programming languages (Compile-Time Virtualisation).
   The Multicore Association have proposed MCAPI as an industry standard for on-chip communications. MCAPI abstracts the on-chip physical communication to provide the application with logical point-to-point unidirectional channels between nodes (software thread, hardware core, etc.). Compile-Time Virtualisation is used to provide an extremely lightweight implementation of MCAPI, that supports a much wider range of architectures than its specification normally considers. Overall, this unique combination enhances programmability by abstracting on-chip communication whilst also exposing critical parts of the target architecture to the programming language.

AB A major challenge in network virtualization is to virtualize the components constituting the network, in particular the routers. In the work presented here, we focus on how to use open source Linux software in combination with commodity hardware to build open virtual routers. A general approach in open router virtualization is to run multiple virtual instances in parallel on the same PC hardware. This means that virtual components are combined in the router's data plane, which can result in performance penalty. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the design of virtual network devices on router performance in Linux namespace environment. We identify performance bottlenecks along the packet data path. We suggest design changes to improve performance. In particular, we investigate modifications of the "macvlan" device, and analyze the performance improvements in terms of packet forwarding. We also investigate how the number of virtual routers and virtual devices within a physical machine influence performance.

AB In writing parallel programs, programmers expose parallelism and optimize it to meet a particular performance goal on a single platform under an assumed set of workload characteristics. In the field, changing workload characteristics, new parallel platforms, and deployments with different performance goals make the programmer's development-time choices suboptimal. To address this problem, this paper presents the Degree of Parallelism Executive (DoPE), an API and run-time system that separates the concern of exposing parallelism from that of optimizing it. Using the DoPE API, the application developer expresses parallelism options. During program execution, DoPE's run-time system uses this information to dynamically optimize the parallelism options in response to the facts on the ground. We easily port several emerging parallel applications to DoPE's API and demonstrate the DoPE run-time system's effectiveness in dynamically optimizing the parallelism for a variety of performance goals.

AB Programming language design benefits from constructs for extending the syntax and semantics of a host language. While C's string-based macros empower programmers to introduce notational short-hands, the parser-level macros of Lisp encourage experimentation with domain-specific languages. The Scheme programming language improves on Lisp with macros that respect lexical scope.
   The design of Racket-a descendant of Scheme-goes even further with the introduction of a full-fledged interface to the static semantics of the language. A Racket extension programmer can thus add constructs that are indistinguishable from "native" notation, large and complex embedded domain-specific languages, and even optimizing transformations for the compiler backend. This power to experiment with language design has been used to create a series of sub-languages for programming with first-class classes and modules, numerous languages for implementing the Racket system, and the creation of a complete and fully integrated typed sister language to Racket's untyped base language.
   This paper explains Racket's language extension API via an implementation of a small typed sister language. The new language provides a rich type system that accommodates the idioms of untyped Racket. Furthermore, modules in this typed language can safely exchange values with untyped modules. Last but not least, the implementation includes a type-based optimizer that achieves promising speedups. Although these extensions are complex, their Racket implementation is just a library, like any other library, requiring no changes to the Racket implementation.

AB The compliance of individual software modules with standard API specifications is critical to create a maintainable and portable software system over the long-term. Even minor shortfalls in API compliance can result in the need for extensive software maintenance. We present an API Compliance and Analysis Report Tool (ACART) that measures and visualizes the degree of compliance of software with an IDL-based specification. A discrete optimization method for finding maximal mapping between a reference API and sourcecode is presented. The optimization technique uses lexical and structural similarity metrics to find a mapping that minimizes the distance between the reference IDL specification and the specification derived from the sourcecode. A prototype is developed to verify and demonstrate the validity of the approach.

AB This paper presents the modifications needed to adapt a humanoid agent architecture and behaviors from simulation to a real robot. The experiments were conducted using the Aldebaran Nao robot model. The agent architecture was adapted from the RoboCup 3D Simulation League to the Standard Platform League with as few changes as possible. The reasons for the modifications include small differences in the dimensions and dynamics of the simulated and the real robot and the fact that the simulator does not create an exact copy of a real environment. In addition, the real robot API is different from the simulated robot API and there are a few more restrictions on the allowed joint configurations. The general approach for using behaviors developed for simulation in the real robot was to: first, (if necessary) make the simulated behavior compliant with the real robot restrictions, second, apply the simulated behavior to the real robot reducing its velocity, and finally, increase the velocity, while adapting the behavior parameters, until the behavior gets unstable or inefficient. This paper also presents an algorithm to calculate the three angles of the hip that produce the desired vertical hip rotation, since the Nao robot does not have a vertical hip joint. All simulation behaviors described in this paper were successfully adapted to the real robot.

CY OCT 17-21, 2010
CL Reno, NV
AB Automated refactoring is a key feature of modern IDEs. Existing refactorings rely on the transformation of source code declarations, in which references may also be transformed as a side effect. However, there exist situations in which a declaration is not available for refactoring or would be inappropriate to transform, for example, in the presence of dangling references or where a set of references should be retargeted to a different declaration.
   We investigate the problem of dangling references through a detailed study of three open source libraries. We find that the introduction of dangling references during library migration is a significant real problem, and characterize the specific issues that arise. Based on these findings we provide and test a prototype tool, called Trident, that allows programmers to refactor references. Our results suggest that supporting the direct refactoring of references is a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art.

CL Reno, NV
AB Reusing existing library components is essential for reducing the cost of software development and maintenance. When library components evolve to accommodate new feature requests, to fix bugs, or to meet new standards, the clients of software libraries often need to make corresponding changes to correctly use the updated libraries. Existing API usage adaptation techniques support simple adaptation such as replacing the target of calls to a deprecated API, however, cannot handle complex adaptations such as creating a new object to be passed to a different API method, or adding an exception handling logic that surrounds the updated API method calls.
   This paper presents LIBSYNC that guides developers in adapting API usage code by learning complex API usage adaptation patterns from other clients that already migrated to a new library version (and also from the API usages within the library's test code). LIBSYNC uses several graph-based techniques (1) to identify changes to API declarations by comparing two library versions, (2) to extract associated API usage skeletons before and after library migration, and (3) to compare the extracted API usage skeletons to recover API usage adaptation patterns. Using the learned adaptation patterns, LIBSYNC recommends the locations and edit operations for adapting API usages. The evaluation of LIBSYNC on real-world software systems shows that it is highly correct and useful with a precision of 100% and a recall of 91%.

AB This paper explores the definition, applications, and limitations of concepts and concept maps in C++, with a focus on library composition. We also compare and contrast concepts to adaptation mechanisms in other languages.
   Efficient, non-intrusive adaptation mechanisms are essential when adapting data structures to a library's API. Development with reusable components is a widely practiced method of building software. Components vary in form, ranging from source code to non-modifiable binary libraries. The Concepts language features, slated to appear in the next version of C++, have been designed with such compositions in mind, promising an improved ability to create generic, non-intrusive, efficient, and identity-preserving adapters.
   We report on two cases of data structure adaptation between different libraries, and illustrate best practices and idioms. First, we adapt GUI widgets from several libraries, with differing APIs, for use with a generic layout engine. We further develop this example to describe the run-time concept idiom, extending the applicability of concepts to domains where run-time polymorphism is required. Second, we compose an image processing library and a graph algorithm library, by making use of a transparent adaptation layer, enabling the efficient application of graph algorithms to the image processing domain. We use the adaptation layer to realize a few key algorithms, and report little or no performance degradation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI An embeddable mobile agent platform supporting runtime code mobility,
   interaction and coordination of mobile agents and host systems
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Agent technology is emerging as an important concept for the development of distributed complex systems. A number of mobile agent systems have been developed in the last decade. However, most of them were developed to support only Java mobile agents. In order to provide distributed applications with code mobility, this article presents a library, the Mobile-C library, that allows a mobile agent platform, Mobile-C, to be embeddable in an application to support mobile C/C++ codes carried by mobile agents. Mobile-C uses a C/C++ interpreter as its Agent Execution Engine (AEE). Through the Mobile-C library. Mobile-C can be embedded into an application to support mobile C/C++ codes carried by mobile agents. Using mobile C/C++ codes, it is easy to interface a variety of low-level hardware devices and legacy systems. Through the Mobile-C library, Mobile-C can run on heterogeneous platforms with various operating systems. The Mobile-C library has a small footprint to meet the stringent memory capacity for applications in mechatronic and embedded systems. The Mobile-C library contains different categories of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in both binary and agent spaces to facilitate the design of mobile agent based applications. In addition, a rich set of existing APIs for the C/C++ interpreter employed as the AEE allows an application to have complete information and control over the mobile C/C++ codes residing in Mobile-C. With the synchronization mechanism provided by the Mobile-C library for both binary and agent spaces, simultaneous processes across both spaces can be coordinated to get correct runtime order and avoid unexpected race condition. The study of performance comparisons indicates that Mobile-C is about two times faster than JADE in agent migration. The application of the Mobile-C library is illustrated by dynamic runtime control of a mobile robot's behavior using mobile agents. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Liquid diagrams are a suite of information visualisation gadgets written in Flex, which visualise live data contained in Google Docs spreadsheets through the Google Visualization API. Users can interactively configure the visualisation and any changes in the online spreadsheet data are reflected immediately in the display. In contrast to other solutions, liquid diagrams gadgets specifically support the printing and export of both vector (SVG) and raster (PNG) graphics versions of the visualisations, allowing users to construct and export high-quality diagrams for inclusion into other works.
   The suite of visualisation gadgets currently available includes: area charts, bar charts, heat maps (choropleths), line charts, pie charts, treemaps, and parallel coordinates plots. Star plots and voronoi treemaps are coming soon.

AB The web 2.0 has changed the Internet landscape, users are no longer only consumers but now also producers of content. The increasing number of personal data published on web service Providers fathered a new kind of applications: the mashups. These third-party applications access users' information through service providers' APIs via secure authorization protocols such as OAuth. But these protocols rely on the users who must blindly grant access to each mashup, with no idea beforehand about its trustworthiness.
   We propose a Reputation model for mashups to address this issue. The R2M solution monitors mashups' calls on the web service Providers' APIs, detects suspicious activities, and finally reports to the user to collect his feedback in order to collaboratively build the mashup's reputation. We describe an implementation of R2m on the Bell Labs' service Dundal.com to prove its feasibility in a real use case. From this experimentation, we plan to collect user experience to improve the R2M key mechanisms and refine the reputation computation.

Nevertheless, it becomes more and more obvious that these two concepts are complementary. Towards this perspective, in this work we introduce an application based on a 3-tier architecture that illustrates the potential for combining Web 2.0 and Semantic Web technologies. This application consists a framework for searching books from Amazon and Half EBay. The implementation's backbone is focused on developing the underlying ontology, writing a set of rules for personalisation and creating a mashup with the use of Web APIs.

CY SEP 12-18, 2010

AB Evolving requirements may necessitate API migration-re-engineering an application to replace its dependence on one API with the dependence on another API for the same domain. One approach to API migration is to replace the original API by a wrapper-based re-implementation that makes reuse of the other API. Wrapper-based migration is attractive because application code is left untouched and wrappers can be reused across applications. The design of such wrappers is challenging though if the two involved APIs were developed independently, in which case the APIs tend to differ significantly. We identify the challenges faced by developers when designing wrappers for object-oriented APIs, and we recover the solutions used in practice. To this end, we analyze two large, open-source GUI wrappers and compile a set of issues pervasive in their designs. We subsequently extract design patterns from the solutions that developers used in the GUI wrappers.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in specification miners that automatically extract finite state specifications of method ordering constraints from existing software. However, comparing different mining approaches is difficult, because no common ground to evaluate the effectiveness of specification miners has been established yet. We present a framework for evaluating to which extent specification miners find valid finite state descriptions of API usage constraints. The framework helps in creating reference specifications and includes metrics to compare mined specifications to the reference specifications. The metrics are tailored for evaluating specification miners and account for imprecision and incompleteness in mined specifications. We use the framework to compare the effectiveness of three mining approaches and to show their respective benefits.

AB Knowing which types of refactoring occurred between two program versions can help programmers better understand code changes. Our survey of refactoring identification techniques found that existing techniques cannot easily identify complex refactorings, such as an replace conditional with polymorphism refactoring, which consist of a set of atomic refactorings.
   This paper presents REF-FINDER that identifies complex refactorings between two program versions using a template-based refactoring reconstruction approach-REF-FINDER expresses each refactoring type in terms of template logic rules and uses a logic programming engine to infer concrete refactoring instances. It currently supports sixty three refactoring types from Fowler's catalog, showing the most comprehensive coverage among existing techniques. The evaluation using code examples from Fowler's catalog and open source project histories shows that REF-FINDER identifies refactorings with an overall precision of 0.79 and recall of 0.95.

AB Malware is an increasingly important problem that threatens the security of computer systems. The new concept of cloud security require rapid and automated detection and classification of malicious software. In this paper, we propose a behavior-based automated classification method. Depends on behavioral analysis we characterize malware behavioral profile in a trace report. This report contains the status change caused by the executable and event which are transfered from corresponding Win32 API calls and their certain parameters. we extract behaviour unit strings as features which reflect diffierent malware families behavioral patterns. These features vector space servered as input to the SVM. We use string similarity and information gain to reduce the dimension of feature space. Comparative experiments with a real world data set of malicious executables shows that our proposed method can classify malware into diffierent malware families with higher accuracy and efficiency.

AB Applications in computer graphics and related fields can benefit from automatic simplification of complex polygonal surface models. High detailed models are used by these applications. These models are too complex for the limited hardware capacity and take so much time to render and to transmit. The problem of simplifying the surface with quality maintenance has been analyzed. An effective algorithm for producing high-quality simplifications of the unsimplified model is a valuable tool for managing data complexity. Surface simplification algorithm based on iterative edge contraction is presented in this work. Quadric error metric is used to find the quality of the model. This algorithm is implemented on 5 different models. These models are simplified at different levels. Comparative analysis has been performed and experiments are repeated without taking care of quality and also compared with quality simplification. APIs are created and implemented in MAYA as plug-in.

AB Multiplayer gaming platforms (such as Come2Play, Skype, Nonoba, Oberon) offer game developers an API to develop new games. Having a secure API is critical to prevent hackers from unlawfully winning a game. Until today, to have a secure API, a developer had to write a server-side extension that determines the game outcome. However, a server-side extension is cumbersome to write (because you have to master two programming languages: for the client- and server side), error-prone, hard to debug, and risky for the gaming platform that runs 3rd party code on its servers.
   This paper presents the first Secure client-side-only API (for short JuryAPI), i.e., the API is secure (the game outcome cannot be changed by hackers) and the API uses only client-side code (without any server-side extensions). JuryAPI mimics real-life games in which each player verifies that other players follow the game rules. In case of disagreement among the players, the server convenes a jury that finds the hacker. Using JuryAPI, one can develop secure multiplayer games using only client-side code, without using any server-side extensions.
   JuryAPI is an open-source standard developed by the multiplayer gaming company Come2Play, with an open-source flash emulator(1). Come2Play freely hosts 3rd party flash games and shares the revenues with the game developers.

AB This paper presents the cljRobust - middleware library, which allows an intelligent control application to be written for Lego Mind-storms NXT. cljRobust is based on Clojure, which is a modern, concurrent dialect of the Lisp language. It shortens the distance between deliberative, symbolic processing and hardware. In this way, cljRobust facilitates the writing of control algorithms which operate close to the hardware layer, and thus are able to quickly respond to changes in the environment. Since Lego robots have been adopted by many leaching academic centers all over the world as a standard tool for teaching robotics, the author hopes the cljRobust library may also be found as an interesting teaching aid in AI robotics.

AB One of the ideas of agile software development is to respond to changes rather than following a plan. Constantly changing businesses result in changing requirements, to be handled in the development process. Therefore, it is essential that the underlying software architecture is capable of managing agile business processes. However, criticism on agile software development states that it lacks paying attention to architectural and design issues and therefore is bound to engender suboptimal design-decisions. We propose an architectural framework, that by explicitly distinguishing computational, coordinational, organizational, distributional, and communicational models offers a high degree of flexibility regarding architectural and design changes. The framework strength is facilitated by a) combining the characteristics and properties of architectural styles captured in a simple API, and b) offering a predefined architectural structure to the developer of distributed applications to cope with complexities of distributed environments. The benefit of our approach is a clear architectural design with minimal mutual effects of the models with respect to changes, accompanied by an efficient realization of new business requirements.

CY NOV 01-04, 2010
CL Vancouver, CANADA
AB Data-intensive systems are subject to continuous evolution that translates ever-changing business and technical requirements. System evolution usually constitutes a highly complex, expensive and risky process. This holds, in particular, when the evolution involves database schema changes, which in turn impact on data instances and application programs. This paper presents a comprehensive approach that supports the rapid development and the graceful evolution of data-intensive applications. The approach combines the automated derivation of a relational database from a conceptual schema, and the automated generation of a data manipulation API providing programs with a conceptual view of the relational database. The derivation of the database is achieved through a systematic transformation process, keeping track of the mapping between the successive versions of the schema. The generation of the conceptual API exploits the mapping between the conceptual and logical schemas. Database schema changes are propagated as conceptual API regeneration so that application programs are protected against changes that preserve the semantics of their view on the data. The paper describes the application of the approach to the development of an e-health system, built on a highly evolutive database.

AB Skype is one of the most used P2P applications on the Internet VoIP calls, instant messaging, SMS and other features are provided at a low cost to millions of users Although Skype is a closed source application, an API allows developers to build custom plugins which interact over the Skype network, taking advantage of its reliability and capability to easily bypass firewalls and NAT devices Since the protocol is completely undocumented, Skype traffic is particularly hard to analyze and to reverse engineer We propose a novel botnet model that exploits an overlay network such as Skype to build a parasitic overlay, making it extremely difficult to track the botmaster and disrupt the botnet without damaging legitimate Skype users While Skype is particularly valid for this purpose due, to its abundance of features and Its widespread installed base, our model is generically applicable to distributed applications that employ overlay networks to send direct messages between nodes (e g, peer-to-peer software with messaging capabilities) We are convinced that similar botnet models are likely to appear into the wild in the near future and that the threats they pose should not be underestimated Our contribution strives to provide the tools to correctly evaluate and understand the possible evolution and deployment of this phenomenon

AB Social networks such as Facebook and Secondlife are popular. Wireless devices abound from affluent countries to developing countries. Social networks need wide area Internet support. Wireless interfaces offer ad hoc networking capability, without the need for infrastructure support. Web on Demand (WoD) aims to bridge the gap between ad hoc social networks (people in close proximity with shared interests) and ad hoc networking. A key requirement for WoD is transparent connection management. This paper makes three contributions: First, an abstraction called VirtualConnection for transparent connection creation and migration, with socket-like API; second, an implementation on iPAQs (Windows Mobile) as a user level library, and proof of efficacy of using this abstraction for realizing WoD; third, evaluations to establish the performance of this abstraction. In particular, we show the performance degradation due to virtualizing the connection is negligible.

AB A replacement of 3rd party tools such as database systems or persistence frameworks occur quite often in practice. Possible reasons are license costs, customer requirements or missing functionality. Such a migration usually means exchanging API calls and dealing with functional differences. Problems occur if some functionality cannot be emulated. This paper proposes and explains the use of aspect-orientation to handle severe problems in migration scenarios. A migration project is introduced the goal of which was to replace the persistence framework Hibernate with OpenJPA. This migration involved challenging problems where the application of aspect-oriented programming has provided simple and straightforward solutions.

AB The cloud computing model leads to the increased penetration of the web applications in the office environment. Designed in many cases to replace traditional desktop software, web applications still lack many of the valuable features present on the desktop that increase usability and productivity. Due to the highly isolated design of the browser, it is currently impossible for web applications to communicate with desktop environment, which usually means sending messages or receiving event notifications. This is often required in order to let the person using the application know about the important events happening in the minimized browser window. By contrast traditional applications can take the control of the desktop at any time. The paper introduces the Web4Desktop framework, a browser/client based architecture designed to overcome these limitations by proving a secure infrastructure that allows web applications to communicate with any desktop software implementing the Web4Desktop API. The framework can be utilized to add desktop integration to existing web applications, a step that requires only minimal changes in the web application's code and greatly improve the user experience because these applications will start to behave more like desktop software.

AB Making applications Grid-aware (or Grid-enabled) requires the knowledge of the API of different Grid middlewares. The complexity of these systems, both in terms of underlying technology and functionality, remains high. Moreover, Grid middlewares like Globus and UNICORE are still undergoing many changes. Grid Application Toolkit (GAT), a high-level API for accessing Grid services, provides application developers with a unified, simple and middleware-independent interface to the Grid.
   In this paper, we present a newly developed adaptor for GAT to access UNICORE services. We also describe how the data management client DataFinder has been Grid-enabled with GAT to access remote files and submit computational jobs to the Grid. DataFinder provides primarily an easy-to-use tool for scientific data management in distributed environments. Within the project AeroGrid, a BMBF-funded project in the German D-Grid initiative, DataFinder is being used as user interface for performing complex simulations in a UNICORE-based Grid infrastructure.

AB Building and debugging distributed software remains extremely difficult. We conjecture that by adopting a data-centric approach to system design and by employing declarative programming languages, a broad range of distributed software can be recast naturally in a data-parallel programming model. Our hope is that this model can significantly raise the level of abstraction for programmers, improving code simplicity, speed of development, ease of software evolution, and program correctness.
   This paper presents our experience with an initial large-scale experiment in this direction. First, we used the Over log language to implement a "Big Data" analytics stack that is API-compatible with Hadoop and HDFS and provides comparable performance. Second, we extended the system with complex distributed features not yet available in Hadoop, including high availability, scalability, and unique monitoring and debugging facilities. We present both quantitative and anecdotal results from our experience, providing some concrete evidence that both data-centric design and declarative languages can substantially simplify distributed systems programming.

AB We describe the first implementation of multi-prompt delimited control operators in OCaml that is direct in that it captures only the needed part of the control stack. The implementation is a library that requires no changes to the OCaml compiler or run-time, so it is perfectly compatible with existing OCaml source code and byte-code. The library has been in fruitful practical use for four years.
   We present the library as an implementation of an abstract machine derived by elaborating the definitional machine. The abstract view lets us distill a. minimalistic API, scAPI, sufficient for implementing multi-prompt delimited control. We argue that a language system that supports exception and stack-overflow handling supports scAPI. Our library illustrates how to use scAPI to implement multi-prompt delimited control in a typed language. The approach is general and can be used to add multi-prompt delimited control to other existing language systems.

TI Multicast Routing in Structured Overlays and Hybrid Networks
SO HANDBOOK OF PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING
AB Key-based routing has enabled efficient group communication on the application or service middleware layer, stimulated by the need of applications to access multicast. These developments follow a continuous debate about network layer multicast that had lasted for about 30 years history of the Internet. The IP host group model today still faces a strongly divergent state of deployment. In this chapter, we first review the key concepts of multicast and broadcast data distribution on structured overlays. Second, we perform a comprehensive theoretical analysis examining the different distribution trees constructed on top of a key-based routing layer. Characteristic performance measures of the multicast approaches are compared in detail and major structural differences are identified.
   Overlay multicast overcomes deployment problems on the price of a performance penalty. Hybrid approaches, which dynamically combine multicast in overlay and underlay, adaptively optimize group communication. We discuss current schemes along with its integration in common multicast routing protocols in the third part of this chapter. Finally, we reconsider and enhance approaches to a common API for group communication, which serves the requirements of data distribution and maintenance for multicast and broadcast on a middleware abstraction layer, and in particular facilitates hybrid multicast schemes.

AB ATLAS is a general-purpose experiment in high-energy physics at Large Hadron Collider at CERN. ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) system is a distributed computing system which is responsible for transferring and filtering the physics data from the experiment to mass-storage. TDAQ software is developed since 1998 by a team of few dozens developers. It is used for integration of all ATLAS subsystem participating in data-taking, providing framework and API for building the s/w pieces of TDAQ system. It is currently composed of more then 200 s/w packages which are available for ATLAS users in form of regular software releases. The s/w is available for development on a shared filesystem, on test beds and it is deployed to the ATLAS pit where it is used for data-taking. The paper describes the working model, the policies and the tools which are used by s/w developers and s/w librarians in order to develop, release, deploy and maintain the TDAQ s/w for the long period of development, commissioning and running the TDAQ system. In particular, the patching and distribution model based on RPM packaging is discussed, which is important for the s/w which is maintained for a long period on the running production system.

AB The migration of existing applications to service-oriented paradigm generate services with variegate behaviours and way of interacting with one another. In some cases, available technologies for demarcating services do not provide suited constructs to codify such interactions. As an example, migrating wireless network planning codes towards a service-oriented environment generates a sort of "nested" services, which cannot be codified with available constructs provided by OWL-S. In this paper, we propose an extension of both the OWL-S ontology and the OWL-S API which enables the description of such services. The validity of such an extension has been demonstrated on a real life application in the area of wireless network planning.

AB During the last decade the rapid evolution of GIS systems has led to enchanced accessibility and increased availability. The traditional content has been enriched by multimedia information and three dimensional models. Virtual copies of the real world have been created, widely known to the average user, yet the information retrieval and the efficient exploration of 3D large scale scenes are still pose serious problems. In this paper, a GIS platform for automatic navigation is presented, using a prototype application, entitled "GIS-Scene-Explorer" or GIS-SE, addressing these problems. Our platform is based on an existing GIS platform. Google Earth is used for this purpose. The prototype is a standalone application, adopting the Google Earth API to retrieve and visualize data. It takes advantage of both public remote database of the GIS system and a custom, collaborative database. Three dimensional models of buildings and multimedia data are stored to the collaborative database, operating under a server - client model architecture.

AB The reuse of software library and application framework is an important activity for rapid software development. However, due to rapid software changes, software libraries and application frameworks are usually not well-documented. To deal with this issue, we have developed a tool, named MACs, that provides developers with efficient and effective access to the API pattern databases for a software development project that are form by relevant source files. After an initial program statement is given, our MACs prototype can correctly predict useful relevant API code snippets. In our evaluation, we present a study investigating the usefulness of MACs in software development tasks. Our experimental evaluation shows that MACs has significant potential to assist developers, especially project newcomers, and provides a reuse method for code reuse from relevant source codes files.

TI A grid-based collaborative virtual geographic environment for the
   planning of silt dam systems
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB To improve the efficiency of planning and designing silt dam systems, this article employs theories and technologies of collaboration and distributed virtual geographic environments (VGEs) to construct a collaborative virtual geographic environment (CVGE) system. The CVGE system provides geographically distributed users with a shared virtual space and a collaborative platform to implement collaborative planning. Many difficulties have been found in integrating data resources and model procedures for the planning of silt dam systems because of their diversity in heterogeneous environments. Unlike most of the current distributed system applications, the proposed CVGE system not only supports multi-platform and multi-program-language interoperability in the dynamically changing network environment, but also shares programs, data and software in the collaborative environment. Based on creating a shared 3D space by virtual reality technology, agent and grid technologies were tightly coupled to develop the CVGE system. A grid-based multi-agent system service framework was designed to implement this new paradigm for the CVGE system, which efficiently integrates and shares geographically distributed resources as well as having the ability to build modelling procedures on different platforms. At the same time, mobile agent computing services were implemented to reduce the network load, process parallel tasks, enhance communication efficiency and adapt dynamically to the changing network environment. Using Java, JMF (Java Media Framework API), Globus Toolkits (GT) core, Voyager, C++, and the OpenGL development package, a prototype system was developed to support silt dam systems planning in the case study area, the Jiu-Yuan-Gou watershed of the Loess Plateau, China. Compared with the traditional workflow, the CVGE system can reduce the workload by between one third and a half.

AB A social network service is one of the most prospering social media in the Web 2.0 era. In SNSs, a massive number of people make online friends and share their interests. In May 2007, Facebook made an announcement of "Open API" policy, which allows a third-party to create applications in Facebook. After "Open API," users of Facebook can utilize various interactions other than just messaging. This led to radical increase in user growth of Facebook and threatened Myspace, which was the top SNS at that time. This innovative move gathered an interest of how "Open API" affects interactions in social networks. The main objective of our research is to analyze the relationship between the growth of social network adoption and network topology. For this issue, our study conducts both analytical and empirical models. First of all, we adopt the concept of Metcalfe's and Reed's law to model the growth pattern of social network under duopoly competition of two SNSs. Then we apply the growth functions to the empirical analysis. We collect web traffic data of Facebook and Myspace from Alexa and test the structural change after the adoption of "Open API" policy. The result of the analytical model shows that social network adoption follows a quadratic growth under Metcalfe's law and an exponential growth under Reed's law. The result also shows the conditions for a SNS to take all new adopters in the market. If the SNS follows Reed's law, it can absorb all new adopters even if that particular SNS is a newcomer in the market. The empirical result confirms that there exists a significant difference in the growth pattern between, before and after "Open API." This implies that "Open API" transformed Facebook one-to-one communication network into a group forming network. Eventually, this transition increases potential connectivity in social network and leads to exponential growth of social network adoption.

AB For constantly changing businesses, it is essential that the underlying software architecture is capable of managing agile business processes and meeting future business needs. Decoupling between applications and services in distributed systems is addressed by e.g., service-oriented architectures. On the other hand, applications and its underlying middleware are still tightly coupled with respect to the middleware's architectural style. As a result of the tight coupling middleware adaptations introduced due to e.g., new business requirements can affect the application as well. In this paper we propose the concept of space-based architecture (SBA), that allows decoupling distributed applications with respect to the underlying middleware architecture by combining the characteristics and properties of state-of-the-art middleware architectural styles captured in a simple API. The benefit of our approach is minimal application adaptations in case of changing the underlying middleware architectural style, which allows for more efficient realization of new business requirements.

AB In the past years, it has been investigated in multiple research projects how shared data spaces can be extended with concepts and technologies from the semantic web area, which led to the development of so-called semantic spaces. These semantic spaces enable clients to publish semantically annotated data at a shared repository and to react to changes of information that can be inferred from this data. The declarative description of logical dependencies and their automated evaluation through the semantic space allow for the development of simple and elegant solutions for various complex communication and coordination problems. The investigation of many space based applications as well as experience we gained during our own work have shown that there already exist several best practices for solving many of these problems. However, no standard solutions have been established yet. In this paper, we determine a set of API operations that are supported by most available semantic space implementations and employ this set of operations as a common language for the description of four generic knowledge-based interaction patterns. The paper introduces certain usage scenarios, illustrates the benefits of using semantic spaces, and should serve as a basis for further pattern descriptions.

AB XSTM is a software transactional memory that can be extended by pluggable components. Extensions can access transactions read and write sets through an API, and process them e.g., for logging, change notification, state persistence or replication. This project explores ways to make memory transactions useful beyond thread synchronization. We describe in particular an application architecture enabled by extensions which aims to combine some of the strengths of shared state and of the Actor model. Shared state offers developers the modeling power of object orientation, and avoids the overhead of copying memory between components. The Actor model offers safety and composability when writing parallel and distributed applications. Our second design goal is to make memory transactions easy to reason about and safe to use. Opacity is achieved using a Multi Version Concurrency Control design where transactions are view-isolated, i.e., run in stable and consistent snapshots of the full memory. Transactions never encounter inconsistent data, do not abort while partially executed, and global progress is guaranteed. The programming model is further simplified by enforcing strong atomicity at the type system level, as transactional objects accessors require an ambient transaction. Finally, our design offers interesting performance characteristics by avoiding mutable shared state. Data is either mutable but private to a thread, or shared but immutable. This allows transactions to run without synchronization (no memory fence) between start and commit, which are themselves implemented in a lock-free way using O(1) memory fences and compare-and-swaps. We describe working implementations on the JVM and CLR for the STM and some extensions.

AB Recent technology developments in the area of services on the Web are marked by the proliferation of Web applications and APIs. The implementation and evolution of applications based on Web APIs is, however, hampered by the lack of automation that can be achieved with current technologies. Research on semantic Web services is therefore trying to adapt the principles and technologies that were devised for traditional Web services, to deal with this new kind of services. In this paper we show that currently more than 80% of the Web APIs require some form of authentication. Therefore authentication plays a major role for Web API invocation and should not be neglected in the context of mashups and composite data applications. We present a thorough analysis carried out over a body of publicly available APIs that determines the most commonly used authentication approaches. In the light of these results, we propose an ontology for the semantic annotation of Web API. authentication information and demonstrate how it can be used to create semantic Web API descriptions. We evaluate the applicability of our approach by providing a prototypical implementation, which uses authentication annotations as the basis for automated service invocation.

AB API migration refers to adapting an application such that its dependence on a given API (the source API) is eliminated in favor of depending on an alternative API (the target API) with the source and target APIs serving the same domain. One may attempt to automate API migration by code transformation or wrapping of some sort. API migration is relatively well understood for the special case where source and target APIs are essentially different versions of the same API. API migration is much less understood for the general case where the two APIs have been developed more or less independently of each other. The present paper exercises a simple instance of the general case and develops engineering techniques towards the mastery of API migration. That is, we study wrapper-based migration between two prominent XML APIs for the Java platform. The migration follows an iterative and test-driven approach and allows us to identify, classify, and measure various differences between the studied APIs in a systematic way.

AB Visual instructional design languages currently provide notations for representing the intermediate and final results of a knowledge engineering process. This paper reports on a visual framework (called WIND - Web INteraction Design) that focuses on both designers' creativity and model executability. It only addresses Active Reading Learning Scenarios making use of localized documents (travel stories, travel guides). Our research challenge is to enable the teachers to design by themselves interaction scenarios for such a domain, avoiding any programmer intervention. The WIND framework provides a conceptual model and its associated Application Programming Interface (API). The WIND interaction scenarios are encoded as XML documents which are automatically transformed into code thanks to the provided API, thus providing designers with a real application that they can immediately assess and modify (prototyping techniques). The WIND conceptual model only provides designers with an abstract syntax and a semantics. Users of such a Domain Specific Language (DSL) need a concrete syntax. Our choice is to produce a Web-Based Mashup Environment providing designers with visual functionality.

AB Modern high performance computer systems continue to increase in size and complexity. Tools to measure application performance in these increasingly complex environments must also increase the richness of their measurements to provide insights into the increasingly intricate ways in which software and hardware interact. PAPI (the Performance API) has provided consistent platform and operating system independent access to CPU hardware performance counters for nearly a decade. Recent trends toward massively parallel multi-core systems with often heterogeneous architectures present new challenges for the measurement of hardware performance information, which is now available not only on the CPU core itself, but scattered across the chip and system. We discuss the evolution of PAPI into Component PAPI, or PAPI-C, in which multiple sources of performance data can be measured simultaneously via a common software interface. Several examples of components and component data measurements are discussed. We explore the challenges to hardware performance measurement in existing multi -core architectures. We conclude with an exploration of future directions for the PAPI interface.

TI A dynamic platform for run-time adaptation
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
AB We present a middleware platform for assembling pervasive applications that demand fault-tolerance and adaptivity in distributed, dynamic environments. Unlike typical adaptive middleware approaches, in which sophisticated component model semantics are embedded into an existing, underlying platform (e.g., CORBA, COM, EJB), we propose a platform that imposes minimal constraints for greater flexibility. Such a tradeoff is advantageous when the platform is targeted by automatic code generators that inherently enforce correctness by construction.
   Applications are written as simple, single-threaded programs that assemble and monitor a set of distributed components. The approach decomposes applications into two distinct layers: (1) a distributed network of interconnected modules performing computations, and (2) constructor logic that assembles that network via a simple block-diagram construction API. The constructor logic subsequently monitors the configured system via a stream of high-level events, such as notifications of resource availability or failures, and consequently provides a convenient, centralized location for reconfiguration and debugging. The component network is optimized for performance, while the construction API is optimized for ease of assembly. Microbenchmarks indicate that our runtime incurs minimal overhead.
   In addition to describing the programming model, platform implementation, and a variety of pervasive applications built using our system, this paper also extends our previous work with a thorough analysis of remote objects and tracking techniques, new contributions in distributed component liveness-monitoring approaches, and expanded microbenchmarks.

AB Source code comments are a valuable instrument to preserve design decisions and to communicate the intent of the code to programmers and maintainers. Nevertheless, commenting source code and keeping comments up-to-date is often neglected for reasons of time or programmers obliviousness. In this paper, we investigate the question whether developers comment their code and to what extent they add comments or adapt them when they evolve the code. We present an approach to associate comments with source code entities to track their co-evolution over multiple versions. A set of heuristics are used to decide whether a comment is associated with its preceding or its succeeding source code entity. We analyzed the co-evolution of code and comments in eight different open source and closed source software systems. We found with statistical significance that (1) the relative amount of comments and source code grows at about the same rate; (2) the type of a source code entity, such as a method declaration or an if-statement, has a significant influence on whether or not it gets commented; (3) in six out of the eight systems, code and comments co-evolve in 90% of the cases; and (4) surprisingly, API changes and comments do not co-evolve but they are re-documented in a later revision. As a result, our approach enables a quantitative assessment of the commenting process in a software system. We can, therefore, leverage the results to provide feedback during development to increase the awareness of when to add comments or when to adapt comments because of source code changes.

AB This paper describes GL4D, an interactive system for visualizing 2-manifolds and 3-manifolds embedded in four Euclidean dimensions and illuminated by 4D light sources. It is a tetrahedron-based rendering pipeline that projects geometry into volume images, an exact parallel to the conventional triangle-based rendering pipeline for 3D graphics. Novel features include GPU-based algorithms for real-time 4D occlusion handling and transparency compositing; we thus enable a previously impossible level of quality and interactivity for exploring lit 4D objects. The 4D tetrahedrons are stored in GPU memory as vertex buffer objects, and the vertex shader is used to perform per-vertex 4D modelview transformations and 4D-to-3D projection. The geometry shader extension is utilized to slice the projected tetrahedrons and rasterize the slices into individual 2D layers of voxel fragments. Finally, the fragment shader performs per-voxel operations such as lighting and alpha blending with previously computed layers. We account for 4D voxel occlusion along the 4D-to-3D projection ray by supporting a multi-pass back-to-front fragment composition along the projection ray; to accomplish this, we exploit a new adaptation of the dual depth peeling technique to produce correct volume image data and to simultaneously render the resulting volume data using 3D transfer functions into the final 2D image. Previous CPU implementations of the rendering of 4D-embedded 3-manifolds could not perform either the 4D depth-buffered projection or manipulation of the volume-rendered image in real-time; in particular, the dual depth peeling algorithm is a novel GPU-based solution to the real-time 4D depth-buffering problem. GL4D is implemented as an integrated OpenGL-style API library, so that the underlying shader operations are as transparent as possible to the user.

TI Reducing threats from flawed security APIs: The banking PIN case
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Despite best efforts from security API designers, flaws are often found in widely deployed security APIs. Even APIs with a formal proof of security may not guarantee absolute security when used in a real-world device or application. In parallel to spending research efforts to improve security of these APIs, we argue that it may be worthwhile to explore design criteria that would reduce the impact of an API exploit, assuming flaws cannot completely be removed from security APIs. We use such a design philosophy in dealing with PIN cracking attacks on financial PIN processing APIs; several of these attacks have been reported in the last few years, e.g., Berkman and Ostrovsky (FC 2007), Bond (CHES 2001). Our solution is called salted-PIN: a randomly generated salt value of adequate length (e.g., 128 bits) is stored on a bank card in plaintext, and in an encrypted form at a verification facility under a bank-chosen salt key. Instead of sending the regular user PIN, salted-PIN requires an ATM to generate a Transport Final PIN from a user PIN, account number, and the salt value (stored on the bank card) through, e.g., a pseudo-random function. We explore different attacks on this solution, and propose variants of salted-PIN that can protect against known attacks. Depending on the solution variation, attacks at a malicious intermediate switch now may only reveal the Transport Final PIN; both the user PIN and salt value remain beyond the reach of an attacker's switch. Salted-PIN requires modifications to service points (e.g., ATM, point-of-sale), issuer/verification facilities, and bank cards; however, changes to intermediate switches are not required.

TI User Interface Migration of Microsoft Windows Applications
SO JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE AND EVOLUTION-RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
AB When migrating a legacy application to a new platform, it is often necessary to recreate the application due to the unavailability or the source code. While there is extensive research addressing the migration of the program logic and modeling of user interface (UI) dynamics, there is limited research dealing with the recreation of the physical graphical user interface. This work investigates to what extent low-level application programming interface calls and graphical comparison techniques can detect and identify objects in the executable version of the legacy application, and then recreate that UI in a new application. Results are reported from an empirical test of 20 applications from multiple software vendors. Findings indicate that the ability to identify objects is dependent on the development platform originally used to create the legacy application. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Fast extraction of high-quality framework-specific models from
   application code
SO AUTOMATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
CT 22nd International Conference on Automated Software Engineering
CY NOV 05-09, 2007
CL Atlanta, GA
AB Framework-specific models represent the design of application code from the framework viewpoint by showing how framework-provided concepts are instantiated in the code. Retrieving such models quickly and precisely is necessary for practical model-supported software engineering, in which developers use design models for development tasks such as code understanding, verifying framework usage rules, and round-trip engineering. Also, comparing models extracted at different times of the software lifecycle supports software evolution tasks.
   We describe an experimental study of the static analyses necessary to automatically retrieve framework-specific models from application code. We reverse engineer a number of applications based on three open-source frameworks and evaluate the quality of the retrieved models. The models are expressed using framework-specific modeling languages (FSMLs), each designed for an open-source framework. For reverse engineering, we use prototype implementations of the three FSMLs.
   Our results show that for the considered frameworks and a large body of application code rather simple code analyses are sufficient for automatically retrieving framework-specific models with high precision and recall. Based on the initial results, we refine the static analyses and repeat the study on a larger set of applications to provide more evidence and confirm the results. The refined static analyses provide precision and recall of close to 100% for the analyzed applications.

TI Towards open decision support systems based on semantic focused crawling
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Recently, many systems, the so-called open-networked systems, have been opened to the public in a variety of ways. Such openness is providing people with not only simple services (e.g., ODBC and open API) but also their local knowledge. In this paper, we are focusing on the local knowledge which is composed of two parts: (i) domain ontology and (ii) business rules. More importantly, the local knowledge is applicable to support logical inferences of decision supporting processes in other information systems. In this context, we propose a novel framework of open decision support system (ODSS) which is capable of gathering relevant knowledge from an open-networked environment. Thereby, we exploit two main methods: (i) context-based focused crawler architecture to discover local knowledge from interlinked systems, and (ii) knowledge alignment process to integrate the discovered local knowledge. As a conclusion, we demonstrate how the merged knowledge can be exploited to support decision making efficiently by conducting some experimentations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When developing application programming interfaces of ontologies that include many instances of ontology design patterns, developers of semantic web applications usually have to handle complex mappings between descriptions of information given by ontologies and object oriented representations of the same information. In current approaches, annotations on API source code handle these mappings, leading to problems with reuse and maintenance. We propose a domain-specific language to tackle these mappings in a platform independent way - agogo. Agogo provides improvements on software engineering quality attributes like usability, reusability, maintainability, and portability.

AB Cloud computing is making it possible to separate the process of building an infrastructure for service provisioning from the business of providing end user services. Today, such infrastructures are normally provided in large data centres and the applications are executed remotely from the users. One reason for this is that cloud computing requires a reasonably stable infrastructure and networking environment, largely due to management reasons. Networking of Information (NetInf) is an information centric networking paradigm that can support cloud computing by providing new possibilities for network transport and storage. It offers direct access to information objects through a simple API, independent of their location in the network. This abstraction can hide much of the complexity of storage and network transport systems that cloud computing today has to deal with. In this paper we analyze how cloud computing and NetInf can be combined to make cloud computing infrastructures easier to manage, and potentially enable deployment in smaller and more dynamic networking environments. NetInf should thus be understood as an enhancement to the infrastructure for cloud computing rather than a change to cloud computing technology as such. To illustrate the approach taken by NetInf, we also describe how it can be implemented by introducing a specific name resolution and routing mechanism.

AB APIs are one of the most important concepts it? today's modern software engineering. They allow, software developers to work independently, and minimize the impact caused by changes in the implementation of software services. Despite their importance, currently there are only a few approaches that guide the design of an API. In this paper, we present an approach, and associated tool, that allows an API client (developer) to evaluate the usability of an API and decide whether to use it (release it). In this aspect, our approach goes beyond previous approaches by performing this complexity and usability AN analysis automatically.

AB As a framework evolves, changes in its Application Programming Interface (API) can break client programs that extend the framework. Repairing a client program can be a challenging task because developers need to understand the context surrounding the AN change. This paper describes SemDiff, a tool that recommends replacements for framework methods that were accessed by a client program and deleted during the evolution of the framework. SemDiff recommends replacements for non-trivial changes undiscovered by other change-detection techniques and also enables developers to look at the context of the changes that led to the deletion of a framework method.

AB The evolution of the World Wide Web has progressed from simple, classic web pages with text and static images only to Web 2.0 pages with rich multimedia content, mashups and desktop-style applications. The cornerstone of Web 2.0 technologies is an API called XMLHttpRequest - an interface that allows network requests to be performed asynchronously without blocking the user interface of the web browser. In this paper we introduce a new operation called AsyncHttpEvalRequest that is the logical extension of XMLHttpRequest for web applications. The main benefit of the new operation is that it allows large web applications to be downloaded incrementally and more securely.

AB Trust and Reputation management play an important role in agent-based Recommender Systems. Although several protocols and ontologies of agents using trust and reputation has been proposed, none of them has been so extensively used and implicitly accepted by research community as those from Agent Reputation and Trust (ART in advane) testbed. The motivation of this adaptation is to facilitate the use of ART principles in real distributed applications instead of a centralized testbed for experimentation. This paper presents an adaptation of the protocols proposed by ART testbed to a codification for the most popular Agent platform: JADE. This implementation follows a coherent API with the FIPA protocols included in JADE distribution for an easy use. We also complement the behaviours of corresponding initiators and responders of the protocols with an ontology formed by a collection of concepts, predicates and agent actions that may represent as the ART application domain as any other service-oriented domain. The proposal has been designed to be applied in domains where multi-agent e-commerce solutions are needed. Future work includes the integration of this ontology and protocols in context-aware scenarios such as an airport.

AB Most of today's software applications are built on top of libraries or frameworks. Just as applications evolve, libraries and frameworks also evolve. Upgrading is straightforward when the framework changes preserve the API and behavior of the offered services. However, in most cases, major changes are introduced with the new framework release, which can have a significant impact on the application. Hence, a common question a framework user might ask is, "Is it worth upgrading to the new framework version?" In this paper, we study the evolution of an application and its underlying framework to understand the information we can get through a multi-version use relation analysis. We use component rank changes to measure this impact. Component rank measurement is a way of quantifying the importance of a component by its usage. As framework components are used by applications, the rankings of the components are changed. We use component ranking to identify the core components in each framework version. We also confirm that upgrading to the new framework version has an impact to a component rank of the entire system and the framework, and this impact not only involves components which use the framework directly, but also other indirectly-related components. Finally, we also confirm that there is a difference in the growth of use relations between application and framework.

AB in regards to applications like 3D seismic migration, it is quite important to improve the I/O performance within an cluster computing system. Such seismic data processing applications are the I/O intensive applications. For example, large 3D data volume cannot be hold totally in computer memories. Therefore the input data files have to be divided into many fine-grained chunks. Intermediate results are written out at various stages during the execution, and final results are written out by the master process.
   This paper describes a novel manner for optimizing the parallel I/O data access strategy and load balancing for the above-mentioned particular program model. The optimization, based on the application defined API, reduces the number of I/O operations and communication (as compared to the original model). This is done by forming groups of threads with "group roots", so to speak, that read input data (determined by an index retrieved from the master process) and then send it to their group members. In the original model, each process/thread reads the whole input data and outputs its own results. Moreover the loads are balanced, for the on-line dynamic scheduling of access request to process the migration data.
   Finally, in the actual performance test, the improvement of performance is often more than 60% by comparison with the original model.

AB The paper presents an experimental parallel metaheuristics framework for solving combinatorial optimization of grand challenge scientific and engineering problems that has been developed based on biologically inspired metaheuristics, modeling of social behavior and cultural evolution as well as trajectory-based methods. A prototype class library for metaheuristics is developed and several parallel computational models of metaheuristics for solving combinatorial optimization problems are implemented. The library contains implementations in C++ of parallel computational models for both population based and trajectory based metaheuristics. Some improvements in the parallel models are suggested and implemented in the library PARMETAOPT. The influence of the parameters on the performance of some of the parallel algorithms is analyzed using the developed parallel metaheuristics framework and performance tuning rules are suggested. The implementations are based on message passing with MPICH2 for the flat programming models and OpenMP API is used for multithreading in the hybrid programming models.

AB At present, the structured P2P algorithms have been proposed frequently. Consequently, the P2P application developers need to learn different API semantics. It causes additional efforts of switching to different P2P topologies for P2P applications. Moreover, it is difficult for the developers to evaluate the performance of an application based on a particular underneath P2P APIs. In this research, a novel P2P framework is proposed to assist in developing P2P applications by using various structured P2P protocols and P2P pub/sub algorithms. We construct the structured P2P functional blocks, including network communication components, P2P topology maintenance and routing, network bootstrapping, as well as pluggable pub/sub services in our system. By Comparing to other P2P libraries and platforms, our framework achieves a great success on providing a flexible and extensible development platform.

AB We propose a programming model for scalable distributed applications. Our programming model aims at applications which have to handle a high number of concurrent network connections in parallel. Such load characteristics appear in Web 2.0 applications and in scientific network simulators. The problem originates at the I/O API provided by the operating system. Blocking I/O is easy to use, but in large scale scenarios the usage of threads and memory is excessive. Non-blocking I/O can theoretically reduce the resource consumption, but it is awkward to program. Our approach utilizes a special language feature found in Microsoft's C# and Python and combines the best of both worlds. Programming is almost as easy as with blocking I/O and the resource usage is nearly optimal. Our solution is implemented on top of Microsoft .NET or Mono/Linux respectively and does not require any changes to the operating system, which is very valuable for its practical application.

AB Trusted Platform Module (TPM) provides the cryptographic functions through the Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The specification of APIs reflects the security policies of the designers, in order to manage and protect the sensitive information of users, which is stored in the hardware module. But the security of these APIs has not guaranteed. In this paper, a formal model to describe the APIs based on the specification is proposed; based on the model, the attacker ability and the system security target are defined. In order to find the API-chain attack automatically, a formal method based on resolution principle and theorem proving is presented, and the method takes in practical using an automata theorem prover Otter; a mechanism of executability determination is also integrated in the method to alleviate state space explosion problem to some extent, and the state of TPM can be guaranteed The proposed theory and method are then applied in the Key Migration Module of TPM APIs to show the feasibility of this method.

AB Modern telecommunication networks and classical roles of operators are subject to fundamental change. Many network operators are currently seeking for new sources to generate revenue by exposing network capabilities to 3rd party service providers.
   At the same time we can observe that applications on the World Wide Web (WWW) are becoming more mature in terms of the definition of APIs that are offered towards other services. The combinations of those services are commonly referred to as Web 2.0 mash-ups.
   This report describes our approach to prototype a policy-based service broker function for Next Generation Networks (NGN)-based telecommunications service delivery platforms to provide flexible service exposure anchor points for service integration into so called mash-ups. The defined exposure API uses Intent-based request constructs to allow a description of services in business terms, i.e. intentions and strategies to achieve them and to organize their publication, search and composition on the basis of these descriptions.

AB Today, the expectations placed on the mobile environment is getting high to the point that users want access to the internet at any time and in any place, exceeding functionality of simple voice chat and SMS to include search, service, and blogging. Amidst this kind of change, big companies such as Microsoft, Symbian, Google. and Apple are jumping into the mobile platform market, and open platforms and open APIs are being introduced left and right. In step with this, countless applications are being developed using open APIs. Open APIs allow developers to develop services closely tied to the device more easily. However, generally there are many difficulties when constraints from application requirements are considered in the design stage when developing applications using open APIs. In this paper, constraints when using open APIs in the modeling stage are defined, and code generation technique for which reliability verification through an appropriate model is possible is proposed. By verifying the reliability by applying the proposed methodology to existing applications developed using open APIs, the proposed methodology was validated.

AB Virtual Reality (VR)-based assembly and disassembly analysis systems have been in use for several years. There have also been various efforts at creating bi-directional integration between CAD systems and VR-based assembly systems. The next step in this integration is to provide the capabilities of CAD and the immersive systems under one umbrella. This paper presents an open/extensible architecture for embedding VR-based mechanical tools within CAD systems to assist in assembly and disassembly analyses. The goal is to allow the user to perform immersive assembly/disassembly evaluations entirely within the CAD system.
   The architecture discussed in this paper is designed to leverage the inherent visualization and modeling capabilities provided by any commercial CAD system, while allowing the user to use any level of immersion ranging from simple tracking and stereo visualization to complete haptics devices. The focus is on providing assembly and disassembly capabilities using mechanical tools (e.g. wrenches, screwdrivers, etc.). The architecture is designed to be open (generic) for easy adaptation with any CAD system (through the API of the CAD system) and any haptic device (through the API of the haptic device). It provides a template consisting of modules and classes, which are relevant irrespective of the choice of the CAD system or the haptics system. The architecture is also designed to be extensible to include advanced interactions and simulations beyond the basic capabilities implemented in the system described in this paper. The CAD model library structure is leveraged for managing virtual tools and fasteners available to the user.
   The proposed architecture has been implemented to provide virtual assembly functionality within CATIA V5 using the VirtualHand (TM) Toolkit from Immersion Corporation. Examples of this implementation using threaded fasteners and tools are also presented. The extensibility of the architecture was tested by implementing a different suite of mechanical tools for a different simulation purpose.

AB When a vulnerability is discovered in a cryptographic algorithm, or in a specific implementation of that algorithm, it is important that software using that algorithm or implementation is upgraded quickly. Hence, modern cryptographic libraries such as the NET crypto libraries are designed to be extensible with new algorithms. In addition, they also support algorithm and implementation independent use. Software written against these libraries can be implemented such that switching to a new crypto algorithm or implementation requires very little effort.
   This paper reports on our experiences with the implementation of a number of extensions to the NET cryptographic framework. The extensions we consider are smart card based implementations of existing algorithms. We evaluate the extensibility of the libraries, and the support for implementation independence. We identify several problems with the libraries that have a negative impact on these properties, and we propose solutions.
   The main conclusion of the paper is that extensibility and implementation independence can be substantially improved with only minor changes. These changes maintain backwards compatibility for client code.(1)

AB The EU-funded XtreeinOS project implements a grid operating system (OS) transparently exploiting distributed resources through the SAGA and POSIX interfaces. XtreeinOS uses an integrated grid checkpointing service (XtreemGCP) for implementing migration and fault; tolerance for grid applications. Checkpointing and restarting applications in a grid requires saving and restoring distributed/parallel applications in distributed heterogeneous environments. In this paper we present the architecture of the XtreemGCP service integrating existing system-specific checkpointer solutions. We propose to bridge the gap between grid semantics and system-specific checkpointers by introducing a common kernel checkpointer API that allows using different checkpointers in a uniform way. Our architecture is open to support different checkpointing strategies that can be adapted according to evolving failure situations or changing application requirements. Finally, we discuss measurements numbers showing that the XtreemGCP architecture introduces only minimal overhead.

AB The Data Location Service (DLS) is one of the core pieces of the data management infrastructure of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) virtual organization in the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. Its duty is to inform CMS users and job submission systems about the sites storing their data. This makes it possible for CMS jobs to run on computing resources that are convenient to efficiently access the data the jobs require.
   The CMS Data Location Service implementation has evolved during the past years. The back-end storing and serving location information has been migrated twice already. The interface for client applications has been however kept stable and decoupled from those of the other data management components in order to make the back-end transitions almost transparent to clients.
   This paper describes the motivations behind the changes the Data Location Service has experienced during the last years. Most important ones were the improvement of query performance and enhancement of the API functionality. In addition, this work emphasizes the fact that a decoupled service interface and the use of a modular lightweight client API has allowed this evolution to be carried out smoothly without the need to modify client applications and effectively avoiding major adaptations of each of the new back-ends offering location information.

AB Mobile IP and SIP give solutions to wireless applications to maintain the connectivity while handover is occurred. However, many existing services need further modification in order to perform advanced mobile behaviours. This study presents a software agent, which performs the undercover maintenance of connectivity at the application layer for handling the mobility in all-IP networks.
   It gives an end-to-end handover solution via proxy-based component using API hooking technology. There is no equipment added, no change of protocol stack and no modification on existing services. While a peer node performs handover, services will not be aware of packets re-directing to the new destination address. An experimental testbed is presented for performance measurement.

AB We propose a countermeasure for a class of known attacks on the PIN processing API used in the ATM (cash machine) network. This API controls access to the tamper-resistant Hardware Security Modules where PIN encryption, decryption and verification takes place. The attacks are differential attacks, whereby an attacker gains information about the plaintext values of encrypted customer PINs by making changes to the non-confidential inputs to a command. Our proposed fix adds an integrity check to the parameters passed to the command. It is novel in that it involves very little change to the existing ATM network infrastructure.

AB Application Program Interface (API) is a general term used to identify a set of high-level routines that can be used by an application program to access and keep track of lower-level services in Operating System (OS), Database Management System (DBMS), graphics system, or a network. Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is an API, which initially is defined by the SQL Access Group (SAG)1 to provide access to different database systems from MS windows platform. The ODBC not only becomes widely accepted standard to database tier-connectivity but also enables database's application to access a heterogeneous data on multi-tries environment and able to connect many registered database engines and simultaneously issuing SQL commands. As we have started studying for ODBC impact upon database since 2003 when ODBC was DBMS-dependent constituent; meanwhile ODBC were being in its preliminary developing stages. This paper investigates the recent ODBC capabilities and issues after a radical change in ODBC component and functionality and becoming DBMS-independent constituent using the practical way of benchmark between Oracle vs. MS SQL. This work is subdivided into section 1 which prologues database connectivity. Section 2 is this research problem. Section 3 emphasizes ODBC-burden's interoperable parties. Section 4 addresses ODBC-burden's victim domain. Section 5 briefly presents benchmark experiment results for this research purposes and verifies the results versus Ken North's results. Section 6 exposes ODBC-burden's sources. Section7 introduces ODBC-burden's key success factors. Conclusion is summarized in section 8.

AB The advent of Web 2.0 drastically changes the playing field and opens a new era of platform opportunities. By opening the platform and making it remix, Google Maps changed the rules. Now, the rest of the industry is struggling to catch Google's momentum and the world of web Mashups. However, what about the conceptual heart of other popular Mashups? We focus on looking for patterns in successful Web 2.0 Mashups. We systemizes concepts from Top50 popular Mashups on ProgrammableWeb- and aim to present five collection of five Mashup Patterns: Data source Mashups, Process Mashups, Consumer Mashups, Business Mashups and Developer assembly Mashups which build platforms to foster innovation in assembly, where remixing of data and services creates new opportunities and markets. In this paper we highlight latest Mashup trends, exploration of the design principles of Mashups architecture, evaluation the most popular Mashups technology for the enterprise level, five options patterns that exist for implementation, and capture the fundamental behavioral aspects of Mashups. What we present in this paper can be generalized for other Mashups.

AB Pervasive computing applications often entail continuous monitoring tasks, issuing persistent queries that return continuously updated views of the operational environment. We present FAQ, a middleware that supports applications' needs by approximating a persistent query as a sequence of one-time queries. FAQ introduces an integration strategy abstraction that allows composition of one-time query responses into streams representing sophisticated spatio-temporal phenomena of interest. A distinguishing feature of our middleware is the realization that the suitability of a persistent query's result is a function of the application's tolerance for accuracy weighed against the associated overhead costs. In PAQ, programmers can specify an inquiry strategy that dictates how information is gathered. Since network dynamics impact the suitability of a particular inquiry strategy, FAQ associates an introspection strategy with a persistent query, that evaluates the quality of the query's results. The result of introspection can trigger application-defined adaptation strategies that alter the nature of the query. PAQ's simple API makes developing adaptive querying systems easily realizable. We present the key abstractions, describe their implementations, and demonstrate the middleware's usefulness through application examples and evaluation.

TI The structural evolution of the Web 2.0 service network
SO ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW
AB Purpose - The purpose of this research is to empirically analyse the structure of the Web 2.0 service network and the mechanism behind its evolution over time.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on the list of Web 2.0 services and their mashups that is provided on Programmableweb, a network of Web 2.0 services was constructed. Within this network a node represents a Web 2.0 service with an open API, and a link between two nodes represents the existence of a mashup service that uses the two nodes.
   Findings - The findings suggest that the evolution of the Web 2.0 service network; follows the preferential attachment rule although the exponent of the preferential attachment is lower than for other networks following a preferential attachment rule. Additionally the results indicate that the Web 2.0 service network evolves to a scale-free network but the exponent of the power law distribution is lower than for other networks.
   Originality/value - The research applied social network analysis to the Web 2.0 service network. It showed that its network structure and the evolution mechanism are different from those found in similar areas, e.g. the world wide web (WWW). The findings imply that there are factors which lower the exponent of the preferential attachment equation and the power law distribution of the degree centralities.
   Research limitation/implications - This paper did not investigate the factors responsible for the low values of the exponent of the preferential attachment equation and the exponent of the power law distribution. However, it is suggested that it could be correlated with the fact that the interconnection between nodes depends on the property of the nodes.

As we have started studying for ODBC impact upon database since 2003 when ODBC was DBMS-dependent constituent; meanwhile ODBC were being in its preliminary developing stages. This paper investigates the recent ODBC capabilities and issues after a radical change in ODBC component and functionality and becoming DBMS-independent constituent using the practical way of benchmark between Oracle vs. MS SQL. This work is subdivided into section 1 which prologues database connectivity. Section 2 is this research problem. Section 3 emphasizes ODBC-burden's interoperable parties. Section 4 addresses ODBC-burden's victim domain. Section 5 briefly presents benchmark experiment results for this research purposes and verifies the results versus Ken North's results. Section 6 exposes ODBC-burden's sources. Section7 introduces ODBC-burden's key success factors. Conclusion is summarized in section 8.

AB Traditional techniques to test a software application through the application's graphical user interface have a number of weaknesses. Manual testing is slow, expensive, and does not scale well as the size and complexity of the application increases. Software test automation which exercises an application through the application's UI using an API set can be difficult to maintain. We propose a software testing paradigm called declarative testing. In declarative testing, a test scenario focuses on what to accomplish rather than on the imperative details of how to manipulate the state of an application under test and verify the final application state against an expected state. Declarative testing is a test design paradigm which separates test automation code into conceptual Answer, Executor, and Verifier entities. Preliminary experience with declarative testing suggests that the modular characteristics of the paradigm may significantly enhance the ability of a testing effort to keep pace with the evolution of a software application during the application's development process.

AB The objective of this study is to apply a domain decomposition algorithm to the Lagrangian based Discrete Particle Method (DPM). The latter deals with the thermal decomposition of solid e.g. biomass fuel particles. It considers each particle as an individual entity that is represented by an instantiation of a class. Modelizing thermal conversion of biomass in real systems involves a large number of particles. This can be achieved in a reasonable computing time only through a parallel implementation able to distribute the particles e.g. objects onto the participating processors. This paper present such an implementation based on Orthogonal Recursive Bisection (ORB) method. Due to the fact that the particles may take arbitrary positions within the domain, a particular issue addressed by the domain decomposition technic used in this work is to generate a load balance for each processors as uniform as possible. Furthermore, the particles are coupled via heat transfer. One challenge for the designed algorithm is then to identify the nearest neighbours of each particle so that the necessary information can be communicated between them. Since the positions of all particles are subject to change and may migrate from one processor to another, the communication links together with the number of neighbors are highly dynamic. The implementation is carried out using the KAAPI API, a C++ library for parallel programming that allows to execute fine/medium grain multithreaded computation with dynamic data flow synchronizations. First results are very promising since they indicate that our algorithm creates sub domains with an average imbalance ranging from 2.5% to 6.3% for uniformly distributed particles.

AB Many threads packages have been proposed for programming wireless sensor platforms. However, many sensor network operating systems still choose to provide an event-driven model, due to efficiency concerns. We present TOSThreads, a threads package for TinyOS that combines the ease of a threaded programming model with the efficiency of an event-based kernel. TOSThreads is backwards compatible with existing TinyOS code, supports an evolvable, thread-safe kernel API, and enables flexible application development through dynamic linking and loading. In TOSThreads, TinyOS code runs at a higher priority than application threads and all kernel operations are invoked only via message passing, never directly, ensuring thread-safety while enabling maximal concurrency. The TOSThreads package is non-invasive; it does not require any large-scale changes to existing TinyOS code.
   We demonstrate that TOSThreads context switches and system calls introduce an overhead of less than 0.92% and that dynamic linking and loading takes as little as 90 ms for a representative sensing application. We compare different programming models built using TOSThreads, including standard C with blocking system calls and a reimplementation of Tenet. Additionally, we demonstrate that TOSThreads is able to run computationally intensive tasks without adversely affecting the timing of critical OS services.

AB The primary motivation for uptake of virtualization have been resource isolation, capacity management and resource customization: isolation and capacity management allow providers to isolate users from the site and control their resources usage while customization allows end-users to easily project the required environment onto a variety of sites. Various approaches have been taken to integrate virtualization with Grid technologies. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines virtualization on the existing software infrastructure such as Pilot Jobs with minimum change on the part of resource providers. We also present a standard API to enable a wider set of applications including Batch systems to deploy virtual machines on-demand as isolated job sandboxes. To illustrate the usefulness of this approach, we also evaluate the impact of Xen virtualization on memory and compute intensive tasks, and present our results that how memory and scheduling parameters could be tweaked to optimize job performance.

SE Studies in Computational Intelligence
AB Great advances in information systems and computer hardware, software, and communication technologies in their background motivated the authors in a work for human intent based and human acceptable automation of product modeling. In an advanced virtual space called as model space, increasingly complex products are described by information for engineering objects. Current product modeling in comprehensive product lifecycle management (PLM) systems suffers from quick development generated problems. Huge amount of relationships makes current product models less transparent. Decisions are not explained by their background in product models so that they can not be understood at applications. In this paper, the authors propose a contribution to solve the above problems by establishment of an extension to current product modeling that can be accessed through standard API. They outlined the problem and background in management of product information and conceptualized human thinking driven definition of product entities. Following this an extension to classical product modeling is proposed towards intelligent content, for information content driven control of conventional model entity generation, and for implementation in industrial PLM systems.

AB Game-based learning is quickly becoming a popular trend in Technology-Enhanced Learning. However, the field is very broad with many different initiatives being classified as game-based learning. On the other hand, instructors are demanding effective ways to track the interaction of the students with the games and to assess the learning process. The diversity is a major issue in this regard, requiring instructors to understand each game and to evaluate different kinds of games in different ways. In this work we present a unified mechanism to gather tracking and assessment information from different and varied games. All the information is stored in an online learning environment, where the instructor can consult it. The keystone of the approach is a tracking and assessment API that can be implemented by different games on the client-side and by diverse online learning environments on the server-side. This approach is illustrated with the < e-Adventure > family of educational platforms, which support this interoperable API.

AB Accessibility has been one of the biggest problems that people with disabilities face in the work place, due to today's rapid change in computer technology. This paper presents the evaluation of several console-based and web-based groupware applications including Outlook. AIM, Google Blog, and Group System's ThinkTank in terms of their accessibility. These applications were evaluated for accessibility based oil various characteristics of the applications such as accessible front-end, hierarchy or list structures. input support, output supports screen reader adaptability: and keyboard access. Additionally, web-based groupware applications were evaluated using Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and U.S. Government's Section 508 guidelines. Fujitsu's Web Accessibility Inspector tool was also utilized to help evaluate the web-based applications. It is found that groupware applications have very limited accessibility through the support of keyboard access. Additional audio support and flattened hierarchies should be considered, to enable some persons with disabilities easy access to groupware applications. Future research should include persons with disabilities ill evaluating groupware applications, to determine preferences. Since many groupware applications provide Application Program Interfaces (API), custom front-ends should be developed to include audio content and to flatten hierarchies aid lists.
